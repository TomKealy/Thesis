\section{Introduction}

This chapter introduces a multi-block generalisation of ADMM, suitable for inference over sensor networks. We propose a decentralised solver for recovering a signal from a set of compressive measurements, independently made at each node. We improve over the model of \cite{Zhang2011b} by not requiring the use of a Fusion Centre to do the reconstruction - this is replaced by softhresholded gradient descent and local communications between neighbouring nodes to recover the signal. 

We also improve on the work of \cite{mota2013d}, by providing explicit, closed form, iterates for a series of functionals commonly used in Compressive Sensing - as opposed to relying on a slow intermdeiate optimisation algorithm to find intermdeiate points. To derive our algorithm, we give new proofs of ideas found in \cite{mota2013d}

The structure of the chapter is as follows: we give an overivew of the (vector) sensing model at each node, and how the global sensning model decomposes into a collection of individual sensing problems at each node. 

We then give a derivation of the new algorithm for composite smooth and non-smooth objective functions. In the derivation we form a global objective, and sho how it can be decomposed into a collection of separate objectives. We give new proofs of ideas in \cite{mota2013d} - specifically we show how the objective decomposes over edges between nodes, and thus the global objective can be written as a sum of local objective functions at each node. Thus each node can exectue a series of simple operations, built up from matrix vector multiplies and component wise thresholding, along with a single step of local communication at each iteration.

We demonstrate the general algorithm on two widely used objective functions in compressive sensing - the LASSO (both with \(\ell-1\) and \(\ell-0\) regularisation) and the Dantzig Selector. We demonstrate recovery on synthetic random signals.

We then extend the vector algorithm to matrix sensing problems, and demonstrate recovery in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) case. We demonstrate signal recovery with a distributed Modulated Wideband converter model. We show that the MMV-LASSO recovery achieves adequate performance for spectrum sensing, both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and in terms of signal undersampling. 


\section{Constrained Optimisation on Graphs}\label{sec:opt-on-graphs}

We model the network of sensors as an undirected graph \(G = \left(V,E\right)\), where \(V = \{1 \ldots J\}\) is the set of vertices, and \(E = V \times V\) is the set of edges. An edge between nodes \(i\) and \(j\) implies that the two sensors can communicate. The set of nodes that node \(i\) can communicate with is written \(\mathcal{N}_i\) and the degree of node \(i\) is \(D_i = |\mathcal{N}_i|\). 

We are considering a distributed variation of the following model:

\begin{equation}
y = A x + n
\end{equation}
\label{eq:system}

Where, \(y, n\in \re^{p}\), \(x \in \re^n\), \(A\in \re^{n \times p}\)/. This is a standard scenario. Individually nodes make the following measurements:

\begin{equation}
\vec{y}_p = \vec{A}_p\vec{x} + \vec{n}_p
\end{equation}

where \(\vec{A}_p\) is the \(p^{th} \) row of the sensing matrix from \eqref{eq:system}, and \eqref{eq:system} is formed by concatenating the individual nodes' measurements together.

We assume that a proper colouring of the graph is available: that is, each node is assigned a number from a set \(C = \{1 \ldots c \} \), and no node shares a colour with any neighbour. This is so that nodes may communicate in colour order, as opposed to communicating individually thus reducing the total number of communication rounds required. 

To find the \(\vec{x}\) we are seeking (the solution to the linear system \eqref{eq:system}), to each node we give a copy of \(\vec{x}, \vec{x}_p\) and we constrain the copies to be identical across all edges in the network. Each node, thus has a separate optimisation to solve, subject to the constraint that it is consistent with its neighbours.

The problem then is to solve:

\begin{align}
\argmin_{\bar{x}} \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{j \in c} f\left(x_j\right) + \frac{\lambda}{J} g\left(x_j\right) \nonumber \\ 
\text{ s.t } x_i = x_j \text{ if } \{i,j\} \in E \nonumber \\
\text{ and } x_i = z_i \text{ } \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, C\}
\label{constrainedbp}
\end{align}

with a particular special case being:

\begin{align}
\argmin_{\bar{x}} \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{j \in c} \|A_jx_j - y_j\|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{J}\|z\|_1 \nonumber \\ 
\text{ and } x_i = x_j \text{ if } \{i,j\} \in E \nonumber \\
\text{ and } x_i = z_i \text{ } \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, C\}
\label{constrainedbp}
\end{align}

i.e. \(f = \vectornorm{x}_2^2\) and \(g = \vectornorm{x}_1\). That is, at each node we minimise a Lasso functional constrained to be consistent across edges but that is separable in the \(l_2\) and \(l_1\) norms.

We can write the global optimisation variable as \(\bar{x}\), which collects together \(C\) copies of a \(n\times 1\) vector \(\vec{x}\):

\begin{defn}
We define vectors \(x_c\), where \(c = 1,\ldots , C\) and write the vector of length \(nJ\):
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \otimes x_c = \left[x_{c(1)}^T, \ldots	, x_{c(J)}^T\right]^T
\label{barxc}
\end{equation}
where \(w_{c(i)} = \mathbb{I}(c(i) = c)\), \(\mathbb{I}\) is the indicator function, and we have written \(c(i)\) for the colour of the \(i\)th node.
\end{defn}

These constraints can be written more compactly by introducing the node-arc incidence matrix B: a \(V\) by \(E\) matrix where each column is associated with an edge \(\left(i,j\right) \in E\) and has \(1\) and \(-1\) in the \(ith\) and \(jth\) entry respectively. Figures \eqref{efig:ex-network} and \eqref{fig:incidence-matrix} show examples of a network and it's associated incidence matrix.

The constraint \(x_i = x_j \text{ if } \{i,j\} \in E \) can now be written 

\begin{equation}
\sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c = 0
\label{compact-constraints}
\end{equation}

note that \(\left(B^T\otimes I_n \right) \in \re^{nE \times nJ}\). Together \eqref{barxc} and \eqref{compact-constraints}, suggests that the problem \eqref{constrainedbp} can be re-written as:

\begin{align}
\argmin_{\bar{x}} \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{j \in C_c} f\left(x_j\right) + \frac{\lambda}{J} g\left(z_j\right)
\nonumber \\
\text{ s.t. } \sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c = 0 \nonumber \\
\text{ and } \bar{x}_c - \bar{z}_c = 0
\label{constrainedbp1}
\end{align}

where \(\beta = \frac{\lambda}{J}\).

The global Augmented Lagrangian \cite{Boyd2010a}
 for the problem \eqref{constrainedbp1} can be written down as:

\begin{align}
L_\rho = \sum_{c=1}^C  \bigg( \sum_{j \in c} & f\left(x_j\right) + \frac{\lambda}{J} g\left(z_j\right)  + \nonumber \\ & + \theta^T\left(\bar{x}_j - \bar{z}_j\right)  +  \frac{\rho}{2}\vectornorm{\bar{x}_j-\bar{z}_j}_2^2 \bigg) + \nonumber \\  & + \eta^T\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c + \frac{\rho}{2}\vectornorm{\sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c}_2^2
\label{aug-lagrange}
\end{align}

This is, superficially, similar to the Augmented Lagrangian for the Lasso problem \cite{Boyd2010a}[Section 6.4]. That is, the terms indexed by \(j\) are a straightforward Lasso problem, constrained by edge-wise variables (indexed by \(c\)) forcing consistency across the network. However, the problem (as currently written) is not separable across the edges of the network as the final and penultimate term represent the constraint that the nodes agree on their estimates across edges. 

To make it possible that \ref{aug-lagrange} can be posed  as a constrained optimisation problem at each node, we introduce the following variable (so that the the final term of \ref{aug-lagrange} is separable across edges of the graph):

\begin{defn}
\begin{align*}
u &:= \left(B^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x} \\
& = \left(B^T \otimes I_n\right)\sum_{c=1}^C w_c \otimes x_c \\
& = \sum	_{c=1}^C B_c^T\otimes x_c
\end{align*}
where we have used the definition \eqref{barxc} in the second line, and the property of Kronecker products \((A\otimes C)(B \otimes D) = (AB \otimes CD)\) between the second and third lines, and we write \(B_c = w_c^TB\).
\end{defn}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{The incidence matrix associated with Figure \eqref{efig:ex-network}}
\label{fig:incidence-matrix}
\end{figure}

The terms \(\|\sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c\|^2\) and \( \eta^T\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c \) of \eqref{aug-lagrange}, can be decomposed across edges, using the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}[Edge Decomposition]
\begin{equation}
\vectornorm{\sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_c}^2 = \sum_{j \in C_1}\left( D_j\vectornorm{x_j}_2^2 - \sum_{k \in N_j} x_j^Tx^k\right)
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\eta^T\sum_{c=1}^C\left(B_c^T \otimes I_n\right)\bar{x}_1 = \sum_{l\in C_c} \sum_{m\in N_l}sign\left(m-l\right)\eta_{ml}^T x_l
\end{equation}

where \(\eta\) is decomposed edge-wise: \(\eta = \left(\ldots, \eta_{ij},\ldots\right)\), such that \(\eta_{i,j} = \eta_{j,i}\), and is associated with the constraint \(x_i = x_j\).


\begin{proof}

\begin{align*}
u^Tu &= \sum	_{c_1=1}^C \sum	_{c_2=1}^C  \left(B_{c_1} \otimes x_{c_1}^T\right) \left(B_{c_2}^T \otimes x_c\right) \\
&= \sum_{c_1, c_2} B_{c_1}B_{c_2}^T \otimes x_{c_1}^Tx_{c_2}
\end{align*}

\(BB^T\) is a \(J \times J\) matrix, with the degree of the nodes on the main diagonal and \(-1\) in position \(\left(i,j\right)\) if nodes \(i\) and \(j\) are neighbours (i.e \(BB^T\) is the graph Laplacian). Hence, since we can write \(B_{c_1}B_{c_2}^T = w_{c_1}^TBB^Tw_{c_2}\), the trace of \(B_{c_1}B_{c_1}^T\) is simply the sum of the degrees of nodes with colour 1. 

For \(c_1 \neq c_2\),  \(B_{c_1}B_{c_2}^T\) corresponds to an off diagonal block of the graph Laplacian, and so counts how many neighbours each node with colour 1 has.

Finally, note that \(\eta \in \re^{nE}\) and can be written:

\begin{equation}
\eta = \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \otimes \eta_c
\end{equation}
where \(\eta_c\) is the vector of Lagrange multipliers associated across edges from colour \(c\). Now

\begin{align*}
\eta^Tu = \sum_{c_1=1}^C\sum_{c_2=1}^C w_{c_1}Bw_{c_2} \otimes \eta_{c_1}^Tx_c
\end{align*}
by the properties of Kronecker products, and the definition of \(B_c\). For \(c_1=c_2\), \(\eta^Tu\) is zero, as there are no edges between nodes of the same colour b definition. For \(c_1\neq c_2\), \(\eta^Tu\) counts the edges from \(c_1\) to \(c_2\), with the consideration that the edges from \(c_2\) to \(c_1\) are counted with opposite parity.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Adding together this with the lemma, lets us write \eqref{aug-lagrange} as:

\begin{align}
L_\rho = \sum_{c=1}^C\sum_{j \in C_c} &\left( f\left(x_j\right) + \beta g\left(z_j\right)\right) + \nu^Tx_j \nonumber \\
& \text{        } \theta\left(x_j - z_j\right) + \frac{\rho}{2}D_i\vectornorm{x_j}^2 + \frac{\rho }{2}\|x_j-z_j\|^2
\label{generic-iterations}
\end{align}

where we have defined:

\begin{equation}
\nu_i = \left(\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} sign\left(k-i\right)\eta_{\{i,k\}} - \rho x_k \right)
\end{equation}

this is a rescaled version of the Lagrange multiplier, \(\eta\). 

Then by differentiating \eqref{generic-iterations} with respect to \(x_j\) and \(z_j\) we  can find closed forms for the updates as:

\begin{thm}
\begin{align}
x_j^{k+1} &:= \left(A_j^TA_j + (\rho D_J + 1) I\right)^{-1}\left(A_j^Ty_j +  z^k - \nu^{kT}\right)\\
z_j^{k+1} &:= S_{\beta/\rho}\left(x_j^{k+1} \right)
 \\
\theta_j^{k+1} &:= \theta_j^{k} + \rho \left(x^{k+1}-z^{k+1}\right) \\
\eta_j^{k+1} &:= \eta_j^k + \rho\left(\sum_{m \in N_j} z_m^k - z_j^k\right)
\label{dadmm_algo_lasso}
\end{align}
\end{thm}

This algorithm can be thought of as follows: each node performs an iteration of (non multi-block) ADMM - i.e. each node solves an approximate Gaussian least-squares problem and then soft-thresholds - and then exchanges the result of this computation with its one-hop neighbours. This explains the inclusion of an extra Lagrange multiplier: the multiplier \(\theta\) controls how far each node moves from its previous estimate in each iteration, whilst the multiplier \(\eta\) enforces consistency between nodes. Note that there is no communication of data between the nodes - only the result the computation in each round.

\subsection{DADMM-Lasso}

\subsection{DADMM-Dantzig-Selector}

\subsection{DADMM-MMV}
In this section we extend our results to the multiple measurement vector (\gls{mmv}) model of \cite{cotter2005sparse}. The model can be summarised as follows:

\begin{equation}
Y = AX + N
\end{equation}

Here, \(Y, N\in \re^{m\times p}\), \(x \in \re^{p\times n}\), \(A\in \re^{m \times n}\)

The \gls{mmv} model is an extension of \eqref{eq:system} where instead of a single sparse vector being estimated, a set of multiple (jointly) sparse vectors are recovered (under the assumption that these vectors share a common set of non-zeros).

The resulting optimisation problem is:

\begin{equation}
\argmin_X \vectornorm{X}_{2,1} \text{ s.t } Y=AX
\label{program:bpmmv}
\end{equation}

which can be recast in unconstrained form as:

\begin{equation}
\argmin_X \frac{1}{2}\vectornorm{AX-Y}_F^2 + \lambda\vectornorm{X}_{2,1}
\label{program:lassommv}
\end{equation}

This can be turned into a distributed optimisation problem, and so solved with \eqref{dadmm_algo_lasso}.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

The model described in section (\ref{sec:sensingmodel}), equation \eqref{system} was simulated, with a wideband signal of 201 channels and a network of 50 nodes (i.e. the signal will be sampled at a 1/4 of rate predicted by Nyquist theory). The mixing patterns were generated from iid Gaussian sources (i.e the matrix S had each entry drawn from an iid Gaussian source). Monte Carlo simulations were performed at SNR values ranging from 5 to 20, and the expected Mean Squared Error (MSE) of solutions of a centralised solver (spgl1) and a distributed solver (ADMM) were calculated over 10 simulations per SNR value. The results can be seen in fig (\ref{msevssnr1}). 

The MSE was calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\vectornorm{Z^k - Z*}}{\vectornorm{Z*}}
\end{equation}

where \(Z^k\) is the result of the algorithm at iteration \(k\), and \(Z^*\) is the optimal solution.

These results indicate that for both centralised and distributed solvers, adding noise to the system results in a degrading of performance. Interestingly note, that the distributed solver seems to (slightly) outperform the centralised solver at all SNRs. This is counter-intuitive, as it would be expected that centralised solvers knowing \textit{all} the available information would outperform distributed solutions. We conjecture that the updates described in section \eqref{sec:opt-on-graphs}, take into account differences in noise across the network. The distributed averaging steps, which form the new prior for each node, then penalise updates from relatively more noisy observations. This corroborates observations from \cite{bazerque2008}.

This observation is (partially) confirmed in figure (\ref{erroriterations}), which plots the progress of the centralised and distributed solvers (as a function of iterations) towards the optimum solution. The SNR is 0.5 (i.e the signal is twice as strong as the noise). Note that after around 300 iterations, the MSE of the distributed solver is consistently below that of the centralised solver.

\section{Conclusions}
We have demonstrated an alternating direction algorithm for distributed optimisation with closed forms for the computation at each step, and discussed the statistical properties of the estimation. 

We have simulated the performance of this distributed algorithm for the distributed estimation of frequency spectra, in the presence of additive (white, Gaussian) and multiplicative (frequency flat) noise. We have shown that the algorithm is robust to a variety of SNRs and converges to the same solution as an equivalent centralised algorithm (in relative mean-squared-error).

We plan to work on larger, more detailed, models for the frequency spectra and to accelerate the convergence via Nesterov type methods to smooth the convergence of the distributed algorithm \cite{goldstein2014fast}. Specifically, we seek to dampen the ringing seen in Figure \ref{fig:erroriterations}
