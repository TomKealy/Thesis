Working the frequency domain, this multiplication becomes convolution (which is equivalent to shifting):

\begin{equation}
\hat{X}_{s}\left(f\right) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty x\left(t - kT\right)
\end{equation}

Thus if the spectrum of the frequency is supported on the interval \(\left(-B, B\right)\) then sampling at intervals \(\frac{1}{2B}\) will contain enough information to reconstruct the signal \(x(\left(t\right)\). Multiplying the spectrum by a rectangle function (low-pass filtering), to remove any images caused by the periodicity of the function, and the signal \(x(\left(t\right)\) can be reconstructed from its samples:
