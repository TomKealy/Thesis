abstract = {A novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the distributive nature of CRSN, the proposed scheme deploys only one single narrowband sampler with ultra-low sampling rate at each nodes to accomplish the wideband spectrum sensing. First, the practical structure of the compressed sampler at each node is described in detail. Second, we show how the Fusion Center (FC) exploits the sampled signals with their spectrum randomly-aliased to detect the global wideband spectrum activity. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated through extensive simulations, which shows that it is particularly suitable for CRSN.},

@article{DeCastro2015,
abstract = {Polymer composite materials are widely used for their exceptional mechanical properties, notably their ability to resist large deformations. Here we examine the failure stress and strain of rubbers reinforced by varying amounts of nano-sized silica particles. We find that small amounts of silica increase the fracture stress and strain, but too much filler makes the material become brittle and consequently fracture happens at small deformations. We thus find that as a function of the amount of filler there is an optimum in the breaking resistance at intermediate filler concentrations. We use a modified Griffith theory to establish a direct relation between the material properties and the fracture behavior that agrees with the experiment.},

abstract = {Projections onto sets are used in a wide variety of methods in optimization theory but not every method that uses projections really belongs to the class of projection methods as we mean it here. Here projection methods are iterative algorithms that use projections onto sets while relying on the general principle that when a family of (usually closed and convex) sets is present then projections (or approximate projections) onto the given individual sets are easier to perform than projections onto other sets (intersections, image sets under some transformation, etc.) that are derived from the given family of individual sets. Projection methods employ projections (or approximate projections) onto convex sets in various ways. They may use different kinds of projections and, sometimes, even use different projections within the same algorithm. They serve to solve a variety of problems which are either of the feasibility or the optimization types. They have different algorithmic structures, of which some are particularly suitable for parallel computing, and they demonstrate nice convergence properties and/or good initial behavior patterns. This class of algorithms has witnessed great progress in recent years and its member algorithms have been applied with success to many scientific, technological, and mathematical problems. This annotated bibliography includes books and review papers on, or related to, projection methods that we know about, use, and like.

abstract = {During the last two decades, concentration inequalities have been the subject of exciting developments in various areas, including convex geometry, functional analysis, statistical physics, high-dimensional statistics, pure and applied probability theory, information theory, theoretical computer science, and learning theory. This monograph focuses on some of the key modern mathematical tools that are used for the derivation of concentration inequalities, on their links to information theory, and on their various applications to communications and coding. In addition to being a survey, this monograph also includes various new recent results derived by the authors. The first part of the monograph introduces classical concentration inequalities for martingales, as well as some recent refinements and extensions. The power and versatility of the martingale approach is exemplified in the context of codes defined on graphs and iterative decoding algorithms, as well as codes for wireless communication. The second part of the monograph introduces the entropy method, an information-theoretic technique for deriving concentration inequalities. The basic ingredients of the entropy method are discussed first in the context of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, which underlie the so-called functional approach to concentration of measure, and then from a complementary information-theoretic viewpoint based on transportation-cost inequalities and probability in metric spaces. Some representative results on concentration for dependent random variables are briefly summarized, with emphasis on their connections to the entropy method. Finally, we discuss several applications of the entropy method to problems in communications and coding, including strong converses, empirical distributions of good channel codes, and an information-theoretic converse for concentration of measure.},

Convex translates problems from a user-friendly functional language into an abstract syntax tree describing the problem. This concise representation of the global structure of the problem allows Convex to infer whether the problem complies with the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to pass the problem to a suitable solver. These operations are carried out in Julia using multiple dispatch, which dramatically reduces the time required to verify DCP compliance and to parse a problem into conic form. Convex then automatically chooses an appropriate backend solver to solve the conic form problem.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a MIMO receiver algorithm that exploits \{$\backslash$em channel hardening\} that occurs in large MIMO channels. Channel hardening refers to the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}H\{\backslash bf H\}\$ matrix become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the channel gain matrix \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message passing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched filtered received vector (whose signal term becomes \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\{\backslash bf x\}\$, where \$\{\backslash bf x\}\$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation on the off-diagonal terms of the \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\$ matrix. We also propose a simple estimation scheme which directly obtains an estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\$ (instead of an estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$), which is used as an effective channel estimate in the MPD algorithm. We refer to this receiver as the \{$\backslash$em channel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP)\} receiver. The proposed CHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems (e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas). For the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD algorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection. This is because the MPD algorithm does not need a matrix inversion. It also achieves a significantly better performance compared to MMSE and other message passing detection algorithms using MMSE estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed MPD algorithm. Further, we design optimized irregular low density parity check (LDPC) codes specific to the considered large MIMO channel and the CHEMP receiver through EXIT chart matching. The LDPC codes thus obtained achieve improved coded bit error rate performance compared to off-the-shelf irregular LDPC codes.},

In a recent paper [Asenjo et al. PRL, 2014], a new definition of a granular entropy, that puts the protocol used to generate the packings at its roots, has been proposed. Following up these results, it is shown that the protocol used in [Asenjo et al. PRL, 2014] can be recast as a canonical ensemble with a particular value of the temperature. Signature of gaussianity for large system sizes strongly suggests an asymptotic equivalence with a corresponding microcanonical ensemble where jammed states with certain basin volumes are sampled uniformly. We argue that this microcanonical ensemble is not Edwards' microcanonical ensemble and generalize this argument to other protocols.},

Generalizing results of both Toms-Winter and Dadarlat-Winter, it is proved that the desirable equivariant analogues of the classical permanence properties hold in this context. For the permanence with regard to equivariant extensions, we need to require a mild extra condition on \$\backslash gamma\$, which replaces \$K\_1\$-injectivity assumptions in the classical theory. This condition turns out to be automatic for equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing C*-dynamical systems, yielding a large class of examples. It is left open whether this condition is redundant for all strongly self-absorbing actions, and we do consider examples that satisfy this condition but are not equivariantly Jiang-Su absorbing.},

Our work extends previous approaches involving polar interpolation for compressive parameter estimation in two aspects: (i) we extend the formulation from real non-negative amplitude parameters to arbitrary complex ones, and (ii) we allow for mismatch between the manifold described by the parameters and its polar approximation. To quantify the improvements afforded by the proposed extensions, we evaluate six algorithms for estimation of parameters in sparse translation-invariant signals, exemplified with the time delay estimation problem. The evaluation is based on three performance metrics: estimator precision, sampling rate and computational complexity. We use compressive sensing with all the algorithms to lower the necessary sampling rate and show that it is still possible to attain good estimation precision and keep the computational complexity low. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing approaches that either leverage polynomial interpolation or are based on a conversion to a frequency-estimation problem followed by a super-resolution algorithm. The algorithms studied here provide various tradeoffs between computational complexity, estimation precision, and necessary sampling rate. The work shows that compressive sensing for the class of sparse translation-invariant signals allows for a decrease in sampling rate and that the use of polar interpolation increases the estimation precision.},

A variety of analog CS applications are reviewed within the unified Xampling framework including a general filter-bank scheme for sparse shift-invariant spaces, periodic nonuniform sampling and modulated wideband conversion for multiband communications with unknown carrier frequencies, acquisition techniques for finite rate of innovation signals with applications to medical and radar imaging, and random demodulation of sparse harmonic tones.

abstract = {The classic problems of testing uniformity of and learning a discrete distribution, given access to independent samples from it, are examined under general \$\backslash ell\_p\$ metrics. The intuitions and results often contrast with the classic \$\backslash ell\_1\$ case. For \$p > 1\$, we can learn and test with a number of samples that is independent of the support size of the distribution: With an \$\backslash ell\_p\$ tolerance \$\backslash epsilon\$, \$O(\backslash max\backslash\{ \backslash sqrt\{1/\backslash epsilon\^{}q\}, 1/\backslash epsilon\^{}2 \backslash\})\$ samples suffice for testing uniformity and \$O(\backslash max\backslash\{ 1/\backslash epsilon\^{}q, 1/\backslash epsilon\^{}2\backslash\})\$ samples suffice for learning, where \$q=p/(p-1)\$ is the conjugate of \$p\$. As this parallels the intuition that \$O(\backslash sqrt\{n\})\$ and \$O(n)\$ samples suffice for the \$\backslash ell\_1\$ case, it seems that \$1/\backslash epsilon\^{}q\$ acts as an upper bound on the "apparent" support size.   For some \$\backslash ell\_p\$ metrics, uniformity testing becomes easier over larger supports: a 6-sided die requires fewer trials to test for fairness than a 2-sided coin, and a card-shuffler requires fewer trials than the die. In fact, this inverse dependence on support size holds if and only if \$p > \backslash frac\{4\}\{3\}\$. The uniformity testing algorithm simply thresholds the number of "collisions" or "coincidences" and has an optimal sample complexity up to constant factors for all \$1 \backslash leq p \backslash leq 2\$. Another algorithm gives order-optimal sample complexity for \$\backslash ell\_\{\backslash infty\}\$ uniformity testing. Meanwhile, the most natural learning algorithm is shown to have order-optimal sample complexity for all \$\backslash ell\_p\$ metrics.

abstract = {The \$(i)\$ reciprocity relations for the relative Fisher information (RFI, hereafter) and \$(ii)\$ a generalized RFI-Euler theorem, are self-consistently derived from the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. These new reciprocity relations generalize the RFI-Euler theorem and constitute the basis for building up a mathematical Legendre transform structure (LTS, hereafter), akin to that of thermodynamics, that underlies the RFI scenario. This demonstrates the possibility of translating the entire mathematical structure of thermodynamics into a RFI-based theoretical framework. Virial theorems play a prominent role in this endeavor, as a Schr$\backslash$"odinger-like equation can be associated to the RFI. Lagrange multipliers are determined invoking the RFI-LTS link and the quantum mechanical virial theorem. An appropriate ansatz allows for the inference of probability density functions (pdf's, hereafter) and energy-eigenvalues of the above mentioned Schr$\backslash$"odinger-like equation. The energy-eigenvalues obtained here via inference are benchmarked against established theoretical and numerical results. A principled theoretical basis to reconstruct the RFI-framework from the FIM framework is established. Numerical examples for exemplary cases are provided.},

abstract = {Online optimization has emerged as powerful tool in large scale optimization. In this pa- per, we introduce efficient online optimization algorithms based on the alternating direction method (ADM), which can solve online convex optimization under linear constraints where the objective could be non-smooth. We introduce new proof techniques for ADM in the batch setting, which yields a O(1/T) convergence rate for ADM and forms the basis for regret anal- ysis in the online setting. We consider two scenarios in the online setting, based on whether an additional Bregman divergence is needed or not. In both settings, we establish regret bounds for both the objective function as well as constraints violation for general and strongly convex functions. We also consider inexact ADM updates where certain terms are linearized to yield efficient updates and show the stochastic convergence rates. In addition, we briefly discuss that online ADM can be used as projection- free online learning algorithm in some scenarios. Preliminary results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

For high-dimensional minimization problems involving large datasets or many unknowns, the forward-backward splitting method provides a simple, practical solver. Despite its apparently simplicity, the performance of the forward-backward splitting is highly sensitive to implementation details.   This article is an introductory review of forward-backward splitting with a special emphasis on practical implementation concerns. Issues like stepsize selection, acceleration, stopping conditions, and initialization are considered. Numerical experiments are used to compare the effectiveness of different approaches.   Many variations of forward-backward splitting are implemented in the solver FASTA (short for Fast Adaptive Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm). FASTA provides a simple interface for applying forward-backward splitting to a broad range of problems.},

abstract = {Why does Deep Learning work? What representations does it capture? How do higher-order representations emerge? We study these questions from the perspective of group theory, thereby opening a new approach towards a theory of Deep learning.   One factor behind the recent resurgence of the subject is a key algorithmic step called pre-training: first search for a good generative model for the input samples, and repeat the process one layer at a time. We show deeper implications of this simple principle, by establishing a connection with the interplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although the neural networks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of \{$\backslash$em shadow\} groups whose elements serve as close approximations.   Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a mechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for features with minimal orbits. Intuitively, these features are in a way the \{$\backslash$em simplest\}. Which explains why a deep learning network learns simple features first. Next, we show how the same principle, when repeated in the deeper layers, can capture higher order representations, and why representation complexity increases as the layers get deeper.},

abstract = {During the last two decades, concentration inequalities have been the subject of exciting developments in various areas, including convex geometry, functional analysis, statistical physics, high-dimensional statistics, pure and applied probability theory, information theory, theoretical computer science, and learning theory. This monograph focuses on some of the key modern mathematical tools that are used for the derivation of concentration inequalities, on their links to information theory, and on their various applications to communications and coding. In addition to being a survey, this monograph also includes various new recent results derived by the authors. The first part of the monograph introduces classical concentration inequalities for martingales, as well as some recent refinements and extensions. The power and versatility of the martingale approach is exemplified in the context of codes defined on graphs and iterative decoding algorithms, as well as codes for wireless communication. The second part of the monograph introduces the entropy method, an information-theoretic technique for deriving concentration inequalities. The basic ingredients of the entropy method are discussed first in the context of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, which underlie the so-called functional approach to concentration of measure, and then from a complementary information-theoretic viewpoint based on transportation-cost inequalities and probability in metric spaces. Some representative results on concentration for dependent random variables are briefly summarized, with emphasis on their connections to the entropy method. Finally, we discuss several applications of the entropy method to problems in communications and coding, including strong converses, empirical distributions of good channel codes, and an information-theoretic converse for concentration of measure.},

abstract = {Online learning algorithms are designed to perform in non-stationary environments, but generally there is no notion of a dynamic state to model constraints on current and future actions as a function of past actions. State-based models are common in stochastic control settings, but commonly used frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) assume a known stationary environment. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in combining the above two frameworks and considering an MDP setting in which the cost function is allowed to change arbitrarily after each time step. However, most of the work in this area has been algorithmic: given a problem, one would develop an algorithm almost from scratch. Moreover, the presence of the state and the assumption of an arbitrarily varying environment complicate both the theoretical analysis and the development of computationally efficient methods. This paper describes a broad extension of the ideas proposed by Rakhlin et al. to give a general framework for deriving algorithms in an MDP setting with arbitrarily changing costs. This framework leads to a unifying view of existing methods and provides a general procedure for constructing new ones. Several new methods are presented, and one of them is shown to have important advantages over a similar method developed from scratch via an online version of approximate dynamic programming.},

We show that this arrangement is practical for performing stereo-vision when mounted on top of propeller-based MAVs characterized by low payloads. The theoretical single viewpoint (SVP) constraint helps us derive analytical solutions for the sensor's projective geometry and generate SVP-compliant panoramic images to compute 3D information from stereo correspondences (in a truly synchronous fashion). We perform an extensive analysis on various system characteristics such as its size, catadioptric spatial resolution, field-of-view. In addition, we pose a probabilistic model for uncertainty estimation of the depth from triangulation for skew back-projection rays. We expect to motivate the reproducibility of our solution since it can be adapted (optimally) to other catadioptric-based omnistereo vision applications.},

Detecting motifs in speech and musical passages, super-resolving images, compressing videos, and reconstructing harmonic motions can all leverage redundancies introduced by convolution. Solving problems involving sparse and convolutional constraints remains a difficult computational problem, however. In this paper we present an overview of convolutional sparse coding in a consistent framework. The objective involves iteratively optimizing a convolutional least-squares term for the basis functions, followed by an L1-regularized least squares term for the sparse coefficients. We discuss a range of optimization methods for solving the convolutional sparse coding objective, and the properties that make each method suitable for different applications. In particular, we concentrate on computational complexity, speed to \{$\backslash$epsilon\} convergence, memory usage, and the effect of implied boundary conditions. We present a broad suite of examples covering different signal and application domains to illustrate the general applicability of convolutional sparse coding, and the efficacy of the available optimization methods.},

abstract = {Software clones have been an active area of research for the past two decades. However, although numerous clone detection tools are now available, only a small fraction of the literature has focused on tool evaluation, and this is in fact still an open problem. This is mostly due to the fact that standard information retrieval metrics such as recall and precision require a priori knowledge of clones already in the system. Detection tools also typically have a large number of parameters which are difficult to fine-tune for optimal performance on a particular software system, and different outputs produced by different tools add to the complexity of comparing one tool to another. In this review, we further explore the reasons why tool evaluation is still an open challenge, and present the current tools and frameworks targeted at mitigating these problems, focusing on the current standard benchmarks used to evaluate modern clone detection tools, and also presenting a recent method aimed at finding optimal tool configurations.},

abstract = {We consider two combinatorial problems. The first we call "search with wildcards": given an unknown n-bit string x, and the ability to check whether any subset of the bits of x is equal to a provided query string, the goal is to output x. We give a nearly optimal O(sqrt(n) log n) quantum query algorithm for search with wildcards, beating the classical lower bound of Omega(n) queries. Rather than using amplitude amplification or a quantum walk, our algorithm is ultimately based on the solution to a state discrimination problem. The second problem we consider is combinatorial group testing, which is the task of identifying a subset of at most k special items out of a set of n items, given the ability to make queries of the form "does the set S contain any special items?" for any subset S of the n items. We give a simple quantum algorithm which uses O(k log k) queries to solve this problem, as compared with the classical lower bound of Omega(k log(n/k)) queries.},

abstract = {An explicit estimate is derived for Kac's mean-field model of colliding hard spheres, which compares, in a Wasserstein distance, the empirical velocity distributions for two versions of the model based on different numbers of particles. For suitable initial data, with high probability, the two processes agree to within a tolerance of order \$N\^{}\{-1/d\}\$, where \$N\$ is the smaller particle number and \$d\backslash ge3\$ is the dimension. From this estimate we can deduce that the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation is well posed in a class of measure-valued processes and provides a good approximation to the Kac process when the number of particles is large. We also prove in an appendix a basic lemma on the total variation of time-integrals of time-dependent signed measures.},

For the branching Wiener process, our results sharpen Chen's by relaxing the second moment condition used by Chen to a moment condition of the form \$ \backslash E X (\backslash ln\^{}+X )\^{}\{1+\backslash lambda\}< \backslash infty\$. In the rate functions that we find for a branching random walk, we figure out some new terms which didn't appear in Chen's work.The results are established in the more general framework, i.e. for a branching random walk with a random environment in time.The lack of the second moment condition for the offspring distribution and the fact that the exponential moment does not exist necessarily for the displacements make the proof delicate; the difficulty is overcome by a careful analysis of martingale convergence using a truncating argument. The analysis is significantly more awkward due to the appearance of the random environment.},

Recognizing that CS recovery is essentially an optimization problem, we endeavor to improve the characteristics of the objective function under noisy environments. With a family of re-designed consistency criteria, SCRs achieve remarkable counter-noise performance gain over the existing counterparts, thus acquiring the desired robustness in many real-world applications. The benefits of soft decisions are exemplified through structural analysis of the objective function, with intuition described for better understanding. As expected, through comparisons with existing methods in simulations, SCRs demonstrate preferable robustness against noise in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while maintaining comparable performance in high SNR regime.},

Resulting bound improves the best known bound (due to Blinovsky'1986) for rates below a certain threshold.

In this paper, we similarly generalize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to Bregman ADMM (BADMM), which allows the choice of different Bregman divergences to exploit the structure of problems. BADMM provides a unified framework for ADMM and its variants, including generalized ADMM, inexact ADMM and Bethe ADMM.   We establish the global convergence and the \$O(1/T)\$ iteration complexity for BADMM. In some cases, BADMM can be faster than ADMM by a factor of \$O(n/\backslash log(n))\$. In solving the linear program of mass transportation problem, BADMM leads to massive parallelism and can easily run on GPU. BADMM is several times faster than highly optimized commercial software Gurobi.},

abstract = {Consider the problem of estimating the mean of a Gaussian random vector when the mean vector is assumed to be in a given convex set. The most natural solution is to take the Euclidean projection of the data vector on to this convex set; in other words, performing "least squares under a convex constraint." Many problems in modern statistics and statistical signal processing theory are special cases of this general situation. Examples include the lasso and other high-dimensional regression techniques, function estimation problems, matrix estimation and completion, shape-restricted regression, constrained denoising, linear inverse problems, etc. This paper presents three general results about this problem, namely, (a) an exact computation of the main term in the estimation error by relating it to expected maxima of Gaussian processes (existing results only give upper bounds), (b) a theorem showing that the least squares estimator is always admissible up to a universal constant in any problem of the above kind and (c) a counterexample showing that least squares estimator may not always be minimax rate-optimal. The result from part (a) is then used to compute the error of the least squares estimator in two examples of contemporary interest.},

abstract = {With the recent explosion in mobile data, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the mobile communications industry is rapidly increasing. It is critical to develop more energy-efficient systems in order to reduce the potential harmful effects to the environment. One potential strategy is to switch off some of the under-utilized base stations during off-peak hours. In this paper, we propose a binary Social Spider Algorithm to give guidelines for selecting base stations to switch off. In our implementation, we use a penalty function to formulate the problem and manage to bypass the large number of constraints in the original optimization problem. We adopt several randomly generated cellular networks for simulation and the results indicate that our algorithm can generate superior performance.},

The main observation is that a variant of the Hopf-Cole transformation relates the 2D equation in radial coordinates to the usual linear Fokker-Planck equation. Hence, radially symmetric solutions can be computed analytically, and our results for general (non radially symmetric) solutions follow from comparison and entropy arguments. In order to show convergence to equilibrium we also prove a version of the Csisz$\backslash$'ar-Kullback inequality for the Bose-Einstein-Fokker-Planck entropy functional.},

Our contribution is a communication-efficient distributed algorithm that finds a vector \$x\^{}\backslash star\$ minimizing the sum of all the functions. We make the additional assumption that the functions have intersecting local domains, i.e., each function depends only on some components of the variable. Consequently, each node is interested in knowing only some components of \$x\^{}\backslash star\$, not the entire vector. This allows for improvement in communication-efficiency. We apply our algorithm to model predictive control (MPC) and to network flow problems and show, through experiments on large networks, that our proposed algorithm requires less communications to converge than prior algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of developing universal algorithms for compressed sensing of stochastic processes is studied. First, R$\backslash$'enyi's notion of information dimension (ID) is generalized to analog stationary processes. This provides a measure of complexity for such processes and is connected to the number of measurements required for their accurate recovery. Then a minimum entropy pursuit (MEP) optimization approach is proposed, and it is proven that it can reliably recover any stationary process satisfying some mixing constraints from sufficient number of randomized linear measurements, without having any prior information about the distribution of the process. It is proved that a Lagrangian-type approximation of the MEP optimization problem, referred to as Lagrangian-MEP problem, is identical to a heuristic implementable algorithm proposed by Baron et al. It is shown that for the right choice of parameters the Lagrangian-MEP algorithm, in addition to having the same asymptotic performance as MEP optimization, is also robust to the measurement noise. For memoryless sources with a discrete-continuous mixture distribution, the fundamental limits of the minimum number of required measurements by a non-universal compressed sensing decoder is characterized by Wu et al. For such sources, it is proved that there is no loss in universal coding, and both the MEP and the Lagrangian-MEP asymptotically achieve the optimal performance.},

abstract = {Given two measurable spaces \$H\$ and \$D\$ with countably generated \$\backslash sigma\$-algebras, a perfect prior probability measure \$P\_H\$ on \$H\$ and a sampling distribution \$S: H \backslash rightarrow D\$, there is a corresponding inference map \$I: D \backslash rightarrow H\$ which is unique up to a set of measure zero. Thus, given a data measurement \$\backslash mu: 1 \backslash rightarrow D\$, a posterior probability \$\backslash widehat\{P\_H\}= I \backslash circ \backslash mu\$ can be computed. This procedure is iterative: with each updated probability \$P\_H\$, we obtain a new joint distribution which in turn yields a new inference map \$I\$ and the process repeats with each additional measurement. The main result uses an existence theorem for regular conditional probabilities by Faden, which holds in more generality than the setting of Polish spaces. This less stringent setting then allows for non-trivial decision rules (Eilenberg--Moore algebras) on finite (as well as non finite) spaces, and also provides for a common framework for decision theory and Bayesian probability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a significant modification to the Random Demodulator (RD) of Tropp et al. for sub-Nyquist sampling of frequency-sparse signals. The modification, termed constrained random demodulator, involves replacing the random waveform, essential to the operation of the RD, with a constrained random waveform that has limits on its switching rate because fast switching waveforms may be hard to generate cleanly. The result is a relaxation on the hardware requirements with a slight, but manageable, decrease in the recovery guarantees. The paper also establishes the importance of properly choosing the statistics of the constrained random waveform. If the power spectrum of the random waveform matches the distribution on the tones of the input signal (i.e., the distribution is proportional to the power spectrum), then recovery of the input signal tones is improved. The theoretical guarantees provided in the paper are validated through extensive numerical simulations and phase transition plots.},

After recasting the resulting Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) as a convex quadratic program (QP) with nonnegative constraints, different optimization algorithms are compared for its solution: (i) a Greedy method, based on different solvers for the unconstrained linear system (Conjugate Gradient CG, Gauss-Seidel, Cholesky factorization), (ii) a constrained CG algorithm, (iii) the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and (\$iv\$) the Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) algorithm, possibly warm-started by accelerated gradient projection steps or taking advantage of a loading history. The latter method is two orders of magnitude faster than the Greedy CG method and one order of magnitude faster than the constrained CG algorithm. Finally, we propose another type of warm start based on a refined criterion for the identification of the initial trial contact domain that can be used in conjunction with all the previous optimization algorithms. This method, called Cascade Multi-Resolution (CMR), takes advantage of physical considerations regarding the scaling of the contact predictions by changing the surface resolution. The method is very efficient and accurate when applied to real or numerically generated rough surfaces, provided that their power spectral density function is of power-law type, as in case of self-similar fractal surfaces.},

abstract = {{We argue that the SM in the Higgs phase does not suffer form a "hierarchy problem" and that similarly the "cosmological constant problem" resolves itself if we understand the SM as a low energy effective theory emerging from a cut-off medium at the Planck scale. We discuss these issues under the condition of a stable Higgs vacuum, which allows to extend the SM up to the Planck length. The bare Higgs boson mass then changes sign below the Planck scale, such the the SM in the early universe is in the symmetric phase. The cut-off enhanced Higgs mass term as well as the quartically enhanced cosmological constant term trigger the inflation of the early universe. The coefficients of the shift between bare and renormalized Higgs mass as well as of the shift between bare and renormalized vacuum energy density exhibit close-by zeros at some point below the Planck scale. The zeros are matching points between short distance and the renormalized low energy quantities. Since inflation tunes the total energy density to take the critical value of a flat universe Omega\_tot=rho\_tot/rho\_crit=Omega\_Lambda+Omega\_matter+Omega\_radiation\}=1 it is obvious that Omega\_Lambda today is of order Omega\_tot given that 1>Omega\_matter, Omega\_radiation>0, which saturate the total density to about 26 \% only, the dominant part being dark matter(21 \%).},

This work studies the following problem. Suppose that we have partial knowledge about the column space of the low rank matrix \$\backslash mathbf\{L\}\$. Can we use this information to improve the PCP solution, i.e. allow recovery under weaker assumptions? We propose here a simple but useful modification of the PCP idea, called modified-PCP, that allows us to use this knowledge. We derive its correctness result which shows that, when the available subspace knowledge is accurate, modified-PCP indeed requires significantly weaker incoherence assumptions than PCP. Extensive simulations are also used to illustrate this. Comparisons with PCP and other existing work are shown for a stylized real application as well. Finally, we explain how this problem naturally occurs in many applications involving time series data, i.e. in what is called the online or recursive robust PCA problem. A corollary for this case is also given.},

abstract = {Let \$G\$ be an unweighted \$n\$-node undirected graph. A $\backslash$emph\{\$\backslash beta\$-additive spanner\} of \$G\$ is a spanning subgraph \$H\$ of \$G\$ such that distances in \$H\$ are stretched at most by an additive term \$\backslash beta\$ w.r.t. the corresponding distances in \$G\$. A natural research goal related with spanners is that of designing $\backslash$emph\{sparse\} spanners with $\backslash$emph\{low\} stretch.   In this paper, we focus on $\backslash$emph\{fault-tolerant\} additive spanners, namely additive spanners which are able to preserve their additive stretch even when one edge fails. We are able to improve all known such spanners, in terms of either sparsity or stretch. In particular, we consider the sparsest known spanners with stretch \$6\$, \$28\$, and \$38\$, and reduce the stretch to \$4\$, \$10\$, and \$14\$, respectively (while keeping the same sparsity).   Our results are based on two different constructions. On one hand, we show how to augment (by adding a $\backslash$emph\{small\} number of edges) a fault-tolerant additive $\backslash$emph\{sourcewise spanner\} (that approximately preserves distances only from a given set of source nodes) into one such spanner that preserves all pairwise distances. On the other hand, we show how to augment some known fault-tolerant additive spanners, based on clustering techniques. This way we decrease the additive stretch without any asymptotic increase in their size. We also obtain improved fault-tolerant additive spanners for the case of one vertex failure, and for the case of \$f\$ edge failures.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a sensor scheme for nanoscale target displacement that relies on a single Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) subject to optical feedback. The system combines the inherent sensitivity of QCLs to optical re-injection and their ultra-stability in the strong feedback regime where nonlinear frequency mixing phenomena are enhanced. An experimental proof of principle in the micrometer wavelength scale is provided. We perform real-time measurements of displacement with \{$\backslash$lambda\}/100 resolution by inserting a fast-shifting reference etalon in the external cavity. The resulting signal dynamics at the QCL terminals shows a stroboscopic-like effect that relates the sensor resolution with the reference etalon speed. Intrinsic limits to the measurement algorithm and to the reference speed are discussed, disclosing that nanoscale ranges are attainable.},

abstract = {Conventional sub-Nyquist sampling methods for analog signals exploit prior information about the spectral support. In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of blind sub-Nyquist sampling of multiband signals, whose unknown frequency support occupies only a small portion of a wide spectrum. Our primary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low computational load on the supporting digital processing. We propose a system, named the modulated wideband converter, which first multiplies the analog signal by a bank of periodic waveforms. The product is then lowpass filtered and sampled uniformly at a low rate, which is orders of magnitude smaller than Nyquist. Perfect recovery from the proposed samples is achieved under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. We also develop a digital architecture, which allows either reconstruction of the analog input, or processing of any band of interest at a low rate, that is, without interpolating to the high Nyquist rate. Numerical simulations demonstrate many engineering aspects: robustness to noise and mismodeling, potential hardware simplifications, realtime performance for signals with time-varying support and stability to quantization effects. We compare our system with two previous approaches: periodic nonuniform sampling, which is bandwidth limited by existing hardware devices, and the random demodulator, which is restricted to discrete multitone signals and has a high computational load. In the broader context of Nyquist sampling, our scheme has the potential to break through the bandwidth barrier of state-of-the-art analog conversion technologies such as interleaved converters.},

abstract = {A Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is introduced, for the purpose of sampling from a target distribution with strongly nonlinear support. The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local covariance structure. Furthermore, the procedure requires neither gradients nor any other higher order information about the target, making it particularly attractive for contexts such as Pseudo-Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adaptive samplers on multivariate, highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world and synthetic examples.

abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely used for solving structured convex optimization problems. In particular, the ADMM can solve convex programs that minimize the sum of \$N\$ convex functions with \$N\$-block variables linked by some linear constraints. While the convergence of the ADMM for \$N=2\$ was well established in the literature, it remained an open problem for a long time whether or not the ADMM for \$N \backslash ge 3\$ is still convergent. Recently, it was shown in [3] that without further conditions the ADMM for \$N\backslash ge 3\$ may actually fail to converge. In this paper, we show that under some easily verifiable and reasonable conditions the global linear convergence of the ADMM when \$N\backslash geq 3\$ can still be assured, which is important since the ADMM is a popular method for solving large scale multi-block optimization models and is known to perform very well in practice even when \$N\backslash ge 3\$. Our study aims to offer an explanation for this phenomenon.},

The algorithm exploits a domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values for contrast scaling factor, S, instead of searching it across [0,1]. Only the domain blocks with entropy greater than a threshold are considered as domain pool. As a novel point, it is assumed that in each step of the encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the encoding process as predefined values, mentioned above, the remaining range blocks are split into four new smaller range blocks and the algorithm must be iterated for them, considered as the other step of encoding process. The algorithm has been examined for some of the well-known images and the results have been compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments show that our proposed algorithm has considerably lower encoding time than the other where the encoded images are approximately the same in quality.},

abstract = {Traditional radar sensing typically involves matched filtering between the received signal and the shape of the transmitted pulse. Under the confinement of classic sampling theorem this requires that the received signals must first be sampled at twice the baseband bandwidth, in order to avoid aliasing. The growing demands for target distinction capability and spatial resolution imply significant growth in the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse. Thus, correlation based radar systems require high sampling rates, and with the large amounts of data sampled also necessitate vast memory capacity. In addition, real-time processing of the data typically results in high power consumption. Recently, new approaches for radar sensing and detection were introduced, based on the Finite Rate of Innovation and Xampling frameworks. These techniques allow significant reduction in sampling rate, implying potential power savings, while maintaining the system's detection capabilities at high enough SNR. Here we present for the first time a design and implementation of a Xampling-based hardware prototype that allows sampling of radar signals at rates much lower than Nyquist. We demostrate by real-time analog experiments that our system is able to maintain reasonable detection capabilities, while sampling radar signals that require sampling at a rate of about 30MHz at a total rate of 1Mhz.},

These simulators can be deterministic or stochastic, fast or slow, constrained or unconstrained, and so on. Optimizing the simulators with respect to a set of parameter values is common practice, resulting in a single parameter setting that minimizes an objective subject to constraints. We propose a post optimization posterior analysis that computes and visualizes all the models that can generate equally good or better simulation results, subject to constraints. These optimization posteriors are desirable for a number of reasons among which easy interpretability, automatic parameter sensitivity and correlation analysis and posterior predictive analysis. We develop a new sampling framework based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) with one-sided kernels. In collaboration with two groups of scientists we applied POPE to two important biological simulators: a fast and stochastic simulator of stem-cell cycling and a slow and deterministic simulator of tumor growth patterns.},

In the non-asymptotic regime, the fundamental limits of fixed-to-variable lossless compression with and without prefix constraints are shown to be tightly coupled. Several precise, quantitative bounds are derived, connecting the distribution of the optimal codelengths to the source information spectrum, and an exact analysis of the best achievable rate for arbitrary sources is given.   Fine asymptotic results are proved for arbitrary (not necessarily prefix) compressors on general mixing sources. Non-asymptotic, explicit Gaussian approximation bounds are established for the best achievable rate on Markov sources. The source dispersion and the source varentropy rate are defined and characterized. Together with the entropy rate, the varentropy rate serves to tightly approximate the fundamental non-asymptotic limits of fixed-to-variable compression for all but very small blocklengths.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing of signals drawn from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) admits closed-form minimum mean squared error reconstruction from incomplete linear measurements. An accurate GMM signal model is usually not available a priori, because it is difficult to obtain training signals that match the statistics of the signals being sensed. We propose to solve that problem by learning the signal model in situ, based directly on the compressive measurements of the signals, without resorting to other signals to train a model. A key feature of our method is that the signals being sensed are treated as random variables and are integrated out in the likelihood. We derive a maximum marginal likelihood estimator (MMLE) that maximizes the likelihood of the GMM of the underlying signals given only their linear compressive measurements. We extend the MMLE to a GMM with dominantly low-rank covariance matrices, to gain computational speedup. We report extensive experimental results on image inpainting, compressive sensing of high-speed video, and compressive hyperspectral imaging (the latter two based on real compressive cameras). The results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.},

The advantages of our system with respect to current architectures are threefold. First, our analog front-end is fixed and does not involve scanning hardware. Second, both the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and the digital signal processing (DSP) rates are substantially below Nyquist. Finally, the sensing resources are shared with the reception path of the CR, so that the lowrate streaming samples can be used for communication purposes of the device, besides the sensing functionality they provide. Combining these advantages leads to a real time map of the spectrum with minimal use of mobile resources. Our approach is based on the modulated wideband converter (MWC) system, which samples sparse wideband inputs at sub-Nyquist rates. We report on results of hardware experiments, conducted on an MWC prototype circuit, which affirm fast and accurate spectrum sensing in parallel to CR communication.},

abstract = {We study the effect of communication delays on distributed consensus algorithms. Two ways to model delays on a network are presented. The first model assumes that each link delivers messages with a fixed (constant) amount of delay, and the second model is more realistic, allowing for i.i.d. time-varying bounded delays. In contrast to previous work studying the effects of delays on consensus algorithms, the models studied here allow for a node to receive multiple messages from the same neighbor in one iteration. The analysis of the fixed delay model shows that convergence to a consensus is guaranteed and the rate of convergence is reduced by no more than a factor O(B\^{}2) where B is the maximum delay on any link. For the time-varying delay model we also give a convergence proof which, for row-stochastic consensus protocols, is not a trivial consequence of ergodic matrix products. In both delay models, the consensus value is no longer the average, even if the original protocol was an averaging protocol. For this reason, we propose the use of a different consensus algorithm called Push-Sum [Kempe et al. 2003]. We model delays in the Push-Sum framework and show that convergence to the average consensus is guaranteed. This suggests that Push-Sum might be a better choice from a practical standpoint.},

The correlation matrix of a finite number of noisy samples is computed and used by a subspace estimator to detect the occupied and vacant channels of the spectrum. In contrast with common methods, the proposedmethod does not need the knowledge of signal properties that mitigates the uncertainty problem.

The algorithms are based on a a reformulation of the original nonsmooth problem as the unconstrained minimization of a continuously differentiable function, namely the forward-backward envelope (FBE). The first algorithm is based on a standard line search strategy, whereas the second one combines the global efficiency estimates of the corresponding first-order methods, while achieving fast asymptotic convergence rates. Furthermore, they are computationally attractive since each Newton iteration requires the approximate solution of a linear system of usually small dimension.},

Here we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong converse rate for quantum communication: For any code with a rate exceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing on the transmitted quantum data. Our result has several applications. Most importantly, for generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum communication over such channels. This for the first time conclusively settles the strong converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial quantum capacity. Moreover, we show that the classical post-processing assisted quantum capacity of the quantum binary erasure channel satisfies the strong converse property.},

However, other penalization terms have proven to have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior models.

In this paper, we analyze joint channel, $\backslash$emph\{carrier frequency offset (CFO)\}, and phase noise estimation plus data detection in $\backslash$emph\{orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\} relay systems. To achieve this goal, a detailed transmission framework involving both training and data symbols is presented. In the data transmission phase, a comb-type OFDM symbol consisting of both pilots and data symbols is proposed to track phase noise over an OFDM frame. Next, a novel algorithm that applies the training symbols to jointly estimate the channel responses, CFO, and phase noise based on the maximum a posteriori criterion is proposed. Additionally, a new $\backslash$emph\{hybrid Cram$\backslash$'\{e\}r-Rao lower bound\} for evaluating the performance of channel estimation and carrier recovery algorithms in OFDM relay networks is derived. Finally, an iterative receiver for joint phase noise estimation and data detection at the destination node is derived. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the application of the proposed estimation and receiver blocks significantly improves the performance of OFDM relay networks in the presence of phase noise.},

This scenario is based on a selection mechanism that identifies the low scale dynamics as the one that is screened from UV physics. The scenario also predicts the near-criticality and metastability of the standard model vacuum state, explaining the Higgs boson mass observed at the LHC. Once Majorana right-handed neutrinos are introduced to provide a viable reheating channel, our framework yields a corresponding mass scale that allows for the seesaw mechanism as well as for standard thermal leptogenesis. We argue that considering singlet scalar dark matter extensions of the proposed scenario could solve the vacuum stability problem and discuss how the cosmological constant problem is possibly addressed.},

abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been popular for solving many signal processing problems, convex or nonconvex. In this paper, we study an asynchronous implementation of the ADMM for solving a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, whose objective is the sum of a number of component functions. The proposed algorithm allows the problem to be solved in a distributed, asynchronous and incremental manner. First, the component functions can be distributed to different computing nodes, who perform the updates asynchronously without coordinating with each other. Two sources of asynchrony are covered by our algorithm: one is caused by the heterogeneity of the computational nodes, and the other arises from unreliable communication links. Second, the algorithm can be viewed as implementing an incremental algorithm where at each step the (possibly delayed) gradients of only a subset of component functions are update d. We show that when certain bounds are put on the level of asynchrony, the proposed algorithm converges to the set of stationary solutions (resp. optimal solutions) for the nonconvex (resp. convex) problem. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ADMM implementation can tolerate the highest degree of asynchrony, among all known asynchronous variants of the ADMM. Moreover, it is the first ADMM implementation that can deal with nonconvexity and asynchrony at the same time.},

We discuss the kinematics of the process for several detection scenarios, both in terms of kinematic variables that are natural from a theoretical point of view and others that are better matched to experimental situations. The deuteron structure is obtained from a relativistic model (involving an approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter equation) as an extension of a previous, well-tested model used in deuteron electrodisintegration. We provide inclusive and coincidence (semi-inclusive) cross sections for a variety of kinematic conditions, using the plane-wave impulse approximation, introducing final-state hadronic exchange terms (plane-wave Born approximation) and final-state hadronic interactions (distorted-wave Born approximation).},

Nonasymptotic bounds are derived for the distance between \$P\_\{S\_n\}\$ and an appropriately chosen compound Poisson law. In the case where all \$Y\_i\$ have the same conditional distribution given \$\backslash\{Y\_i\backslash neq 0\backslash\}\$, a bound on the relative entropy distance between \$P\_\{S\_n\}\$ and the compound Poisson distribution is derived, based on the data-processing property of relative entropy and earlier Poisson approximation results. When the \$Y\_i\$ have arbitrary distributions, corresponding bounds are derived in terms of the total variation distance. The main technical ingredient is the introduction of two "information functionals," and the analysis of their properties. These information functionals play a role analogous to that of the classical Fisher information in normal approximation.

Approximate message passing (AMP) methods, based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation, have recently attracted considerable attention for such problems. For large random transforms, these methods exhibit fast convergence and admit precise analytic characterizations with testable conditions for optimality, even for certain non-convex problem instances. However, the behavior of AMP under general transforms is not fully understood. In this paper, we consider the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm and relate the method to more common optimization techniques. This analysis enables a precise characterization of the GAMP algorithm fixed-points that applies to arbitrary transforms. In particular, we show that the fixed points of the so-called max-sum GAMP algorithm for MAP estimation are critical points of a constrained maximization of the posterior density. The fixed-points of the sum-product GAMP algorithm for estimation of the posterior marginals can be interpreted as critical points of a certain free energy.},

In particular, this implies that the mass on level sets of a probability density decays uniformly under the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This confirms positively the Gaussian case of Talagrand's convolution conjecture (1989).},

abstract = {We consider the estimation of an i.i.d.$\backslash$ random vector observed through a linear transform followed by a componentwise, probabilistic (possibly nonlinear) measurement channel. A novel algorithm, called generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), is presented that provides computationally efficient approximate implementations of max-sum and sum-problem loopy belief propagation for such problems. The algorithm extends earlier approximate message passing methods to incorporate arbitrary distributions on both the input and output of the transform and can be applied to a wide range of problems in nonlinear compressed sensing and learning.   Extending an analysis by Bayati and Montanari, we argue that the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the GAMP method under large, i.i.d. Gaussian transforms is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. From the SE equations, one can $\backslash$emph\{exactly\} predict the asymptotic value of virtually any componentwise performance metric including mean-squared error or detection accuracy. Moreover, the analysis is valid for arbitrary input and output distributions, even when the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex. The results match predictions by Guo and Wang for relaxed belief propagation on large sparse matrices and, in certain instances, also agree with the optimal performance predicted by the replica method. The GAMP methodology thus provides a computationally efficient methodology, applicable to a large class of non-Gaussian estimation problems with precise asymptotic performance guarantees.},

abstract = {Many hard computational social choice problems are known to become tractable when voters' preferences belong to a restricted domain, such as those of single-peaked or single-crossing preferences. However, to date, all algorithmic results of this type have been obtained for the setting where each voter's preference list is a total order of candidates. The goal of this paper is to extend this line of research to the setting where voters' preferences are dichotomous, i.e., each voter approves a subset of candidates and disapproves the remaining candidates. We propose several analogues of the notions of single-peaked and single-crossing preferences for dichotomous profiles and investigate the relationships among them. We then demonstrate that for some of these notions the respective restricted domains admit efficient algorithms for computationally hard approval-based multi-winner rules.},

abstract = {Emission from blazar jets in the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared is polarized. If these low-energy photons were inverse-Compton scattered, the upscattered high-energy photons retain a fraction of the polarization. Current and future X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters such as INTEGRAL-SPI, PoGOLITE, X-Calibur, Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter, GEMS-like missions, ASTRO-H, and POLARIX have the potential to discover polarized X-rays and gamma-rays from blazar jets for the first time. Detection of such polarization will open a qualitatively new window into high-energy blazar emission; actual measurements of polarization degree and angle will quantitatively test theories of jet emission mechanisms. We examine the detection prospects of blazars by these polarimetry missions using examples of 3C 279, PKS 1510-089, and 3C 454.3, bright sources with relatively high degrees of low-energy polarization. We conclude that while balloon polarimeters will be challenged to detect blazars within reasonable observational times (with X-Calibur offering the most promising prospects), space-based missions should detect the brightest blazars for polarization fractions down to a few percent. Typical flaring activity of blazars could boost the overall number of polarimetric detections by nearly a factor of five to six purely accounting for flux increase of the brightest of the comprehensive, all-sky, Fermi-LAT blazar distribution. The instantaneous increase in the number of detections is approximately a factor of two, assuming a duty cycle of 20\% for every source. The detectability of particular blazars may be reduced if variations in the flux and polarization fraction are anticorrelated. Simultaneous use of variability and polarization trends could guide the selection of blazars for high-energy polarimetric observations.},

In a separable optimization problem there is a private cost function and a private constraint set at each node. The goal is to minimize the sum of all the cost functions, constraining the solution to be in the intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven to converge when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are strongly convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems from signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed sensing, and support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM requires less communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve a given accuracy level. Algorithms with low communication requirements are important, for example, in sensor networks, where sensors are typically battery-operated and communicating is the most energy consuming operation.},

abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

Hence, radially symmetric solutions can be computed analytically, and our results for general (non radially symmetric) solutions follow from comparison and entropy arguments.

abstract = {This paper derives fundamental limits on the performance of compressive classification when the source is a mixture of Gaussians. It provides an asymptotic analysis of a Bhattacharya based upper bound on the misclassification probability for the optimal Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) classifier that depends on quantities that are dual to the concepts of diversity-order and coding gain in multi-antenna communications. The diversity-order of the measurement system determines the rate at which the probability of misclassification decays with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the low-noise regime. The counterpart of coding gain is the measurement gain which determines the power offset of the probability of misclassification in the low-noise regime. These two quantities make it possible to quantify differences in misclassification probability between random measurement and (diversity-order) optimized measurement. Results are presented for two-class classification problems first with zero-mean Gaussians then with nonzero-mean Gaussians, and finally for multiple-class Gaussian classification problems. The behavior of misclassification probability is revealed to be intimately related to certain fundamental geometric quantities determined by the measurement system, the source and their interplay. Numerical results, representative of compressive classification of a mixture of Gaussians, demonstrate alignment of the actual misclassification probability with the Bhattacharya based upper bound. The connection between the misclassification performance and the alignment between source and measurement geometry may be used to guide the design of dictionaries for compressive classification.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for robust PCA -- the task of recovering a low-rank matrix from sparse corruptions that are of unknown value and support. Our method involves alternating between projecting appropriate residuals onto the set of low-rank matrices, and the set of sparse matrices; each projection is \{$\backslash$em non-convex\} but easy to compute. In spite of this non-convexity, we establish exact recovery of the low-rank matrix, under the same conditions that are required by existing methods (which are based on convex optimization). For an \$m \backslash times n\$ input matrix (\$m \backslash leq n)\$, our method has a running time of \$O(r\^{}2mn)\$ per iteration, and needs \$O(\backslash log(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ iterations to reach an accuracy of \$\backslash epsilon\$. This is close to the running time of simple PCA via the power method, which requires \$O(rmn)\$ per iteration, and \$O(\backslash log(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ iterations. In contrast, existing methods for robust PCA, which are based on convex optimization, have \$O(m\^{}2n)\$ complexity per iteration, and take \$O(1/\backslash epsilon)\$ iterations, i.e., exponentially more iterations for the same accuracy.   Experiments on both synthetic and real data establishes the improved speed and accuracy of our method over existing convex implementations.},

Motivated by wireless ad-hoc networks "soft" or "probabilistic" connection models have recently been introduced, involving a "connection function" H(r) that gives the probability that two nodes at distance r are linked (directly connect). In many applications (not only wireless networks), it is desirable that the graph is connected, that is every node is linked to every other node in a multihop fashion. Here, the connection probability of a dense network in a convex domain in two or three dimensions is expressed in terms of contributions from boundary components, for a very general class of connection functions. It turns out that only a few quantities such as moments of the connection function appear. Good agreement is found with special cases from previous studies and with numerical simulations.},

Extensive numerical experiments further showed that their dynamics is accurately tracked by a simple one-dimensional iteration termed state evolution. In this paper we provide the first rigorous foundation to state evolution. We prove that indeed it holds asymptotically in the large system limit for sensing matrices with independent and identically distributed gaussian entries.   While our focus is on message passing algorithms for compressed sensing, the analysis extends beyond this setting, to a general class of algorithms on dense graphs. In this context, state evolution plays the role that density evolution has for sparse graphs.   The proof technique is fundamentally different from the standard approach to density evolution, in that it copes with large number of short loops in the underlying factor graph. It relies instead on a conditioning technique recently developed by Erwin Bolthausen in the context of spin glass theory.},

abstract = {The objective of machine learning is to extract useful information from data, while privacy is preserved by concealing information. Thus it seems hard to reconcile these competing interests. However, they frequently must be balanced when mining sensitive data. For example, medical research represents an important application where it is necessary both to extract useful information and protect patient privacy. One way to resolve the conflict is to extract general characteristics of whole populations without disclosing the private information of individuals.   In this paper, we consider differential privacy, one of the most popular and powerful definitions of privacy. We explore the interplay between machine learning and differential privacy, namely privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms and learning-based data release mechanisms. We also describe some theoretical results that address what can be learned differentially privately and upper bounds of loss functions for differentially private algorithms.   Finally, we present some open questions, including how to incorporate public data, how to deal with missing data in private datasets, and whether, as the number of observed samples grows arbitrarily large, differentially private machine learning algorithms can be achieved at no cost to utility as compared to corresponding non-differentially private algorithms.},

abstract = {The primary goal in cluster analysis is to discover natural groupings of objects. The field of cluster analysis is crowded with diverse methods that make special assumptions about data and address different scientific aims. Despite its shortcomings in accuracy, hierarchical clustering is the dominant clustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find the trees constructed by hierarchical clustering visually appealing and in tune with their evolutionary perspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales simultaneously. This is essential, for instance, in transcriptome data where one may be interested in making qualitative inferences about how lower-order relationships like gene modules lead to higher-order relationships like pathways or biological processes. The recently developed method of convex clustering preserves the visual appeal of hierarchical clustering while ameliorating its propensity to make false inferences in the presence of outliers and noise. The current paper exploits the proximal distance principle to construct a novel algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. The solution paths generated by convex clustering reveal relationships between clusters that are hidden by static methods such as k-means clustering. Our convex clustering software separates parameters, accommodates missing data, and supports prior information on relationships. The software is implemented on ATI and nVidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for maximal speed. Several biological examples illustrate the strengths of convex clustering and the ability of the proximal distance algorithm to handle high-dimensional problems.},

abstract = {We advocate a compressed sensing strategy that consists of multiplying the signal of interest by a wide bandwidth modulation before projection onto randomly selected vectors of an orthonormal basis. Firstly, in a digital setting with random modulation, considering a whole class of sensing bases including the Fourier basis, we prove that the technique is universal in the sense that the required number of measurements for accurate recovery is optimal and independent of the sparsity basis. This universality stems from a drastic decrease of coherence between the sparsity and the sensing bases, which for a Fourier sensing basis relates to a spread of the original signal spectrum by the modulation (hence the name "spread spectrum"). The approach is also efficient as sensing matrices with fast matrix multiplication algorithms can be used, in particular in the case of Fourier measurements. Secondly, these results are confirmed by a numerical analysis of the phase transition of the l1- minimization problem. Finally, we show that the spread spectrum technique remains effective in an analog setting with chirp modulation for application to realistic Fourier imaging. We illustrate these findings in the context of radio interferometry and magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {This work considers aspects of almost holomorphic and meromorphic Siegel modular forms from the perspective of physics and mathematics. The first part is concerned with (refined) topological string theory and the direct integration of the holomorphic anomaly equations. Here, a central object to compute higher genus amplitudes, which serve as the generating functions of various enumerative invariants, is provided by the so-called propagator. We derive a universal expression for the propagator for geometries that have mirror curves of genus two which is given by the derivative of the logarithm of Igusa's cusp form of weight 10. In addition, we illustrate our findings by solving the refined topological string on the resolutions of the three toric orbifolds of order three, five and six.   In the second part, we give explicit expressions for lowering and raising operators on Siegel modular forms, and define almost holomorphic Siegel modular forms based on them. Extending the theory of Fourier-Jacobi expansions to almost holomorphic Siegel modular forms and building up on recent work by Pitale, Saha, and Schmidt, we can show that there is no analogue of the almost holomorphic elliptic second Eisenstein series. In the case of genus 2, we provide an almost meromorphic substitute for it. This, in particular, leads us to a generalization of Ramanujan's differential equation for the second Eisenstein series.   The two parts are intertwined by the observation that the meromorphic analogue of the almost holomorphic second Eisenstein series coincides with the physical propagator. In addition, the generalized Ramanujan identities match precisely the physical consistency conditions that need to be imposed on the propagator.},

Modern technological and societal advances now demand the study of sometimes extremely large populations and simultaneously require fast signal processing due to accelerated system dynamics. This results in not-so-large practical ratios \$n/N\$, sometimes even smaller than one. A disruptive change in classical signal processing methods has therefore been initiated in the past ten years, mostly spurred by the field of large dimensional random matrix theory. The early works in random matrix theory for signal processing applications are however scarce and highly technical. This tutorial provides an accessible methodological introduction to the modern tools of random matrix theory and to the signal processing methods derived from them, with an emphasis on simple illustrative examples.},

abstract = {Recent research indicates that many convex optimization problems with random constraints exhibit a phase transition as the number of constraints increases. For example, this phenomenon emerges in the \$\backslash ell\_1\$ minimization method for identifying a sparse vector from random linear measurements. Indeed, the \$\backslash ell\_1\$ approach succeeds with high probability when the number of measurements exceeds a threshold that depends on the sparsity level; otherwise, it fails with high probability.   This paper provides the first rigorous analysis that explains why phase transitions are ubiquitous in random convex optimization problems. It also describes tools for making reliable predictions about the quantitative aspects of the transition, including the location and the width of the transition region. These techniques apply to regularized linear inverse problems with random measurements, to demixing problems under a random incoherence model, and also to cone programs with random affine constraints.   The applied results depend on foundational research in conic geometry. This paper introduces a summary parameter, called the statistical dimension, that canonically extends the dimension of a linear subspace to the class of convex cones. The main technical result demonstrates that the sequence of intrinsic volumes of a convex cone concentrates sharply around the statistical dimension. This fact leads to accurate bounds on the probability that a randomly rotated cone shares a ray with a fixed cone.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field that has attracted considerable research interest over the past few years. Previous review articles in CS limit their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including continuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and measurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging theory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new directions as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of serving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field, and as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing ideas in perspective of practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper deals with an extremal problem for bounded harmonic functions in the unit ball of \$\backslash mathbf\{R\}\^{}n\$. We consider the generalized Khavinson problem in a specific situation -- near the boundary of the unit ball. This problem was precisely formulated by G. Kresin and V. Maz'ya for harmonic functions in the unit ball and in the half--space of \$\backslash mathbf\{R\}\^{}n\$. The aim is to find the optimal pointwise estimates for the norm of the gradient of real--valued harmonic functions. In the case of the unit disc, or the half--plane, theses estimates are well known, and may be seen as the consequences of the classical Schwarz lemma.},

abstract = {We introduce an invariant of tangles in Khovanov homology by considering a natural inverse system of Khovanov homology groups. As application, we derive an invariant of strongly invertible knots; this invariant takes the form of a graded vector space that vanishes if and only if the strongly invertible knot is trivial. While closely tied to Khovanov homology -- and hence the Jones polynomial -- we observe that this new invariant detects non-amphicheirality in subtle cases where Khovanov homology fails to do so. In fact, we exhibit examples of knots that are not distinguished by Khovanov homology but, owing to the presence of a strong inversion, may be distinguished using our invariant. This work suggests a strengthened relationship between Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology by way of two-fold branched covers that we formulate in a series of conjectures.},

@article{Sason2012,
abstract = {The first part of this work considers the entropy of the sum of (possibly dependent and non-identically distributed) Bernoulli random variables. Upper bounds on the error that follows from an approximation of this entropy by the entropy of a Poisson random variable with the same mean are derived via the Chen-Stein method. The second part of this work derives new lower bounds on the total variation (TV) distance and relative entropy between the distribution of the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables and the Poisson distribution. The starting point of the derivation of the new bounds in the second part of this work is an introduction of a new lower bound on the total variation distance, whose derivation generalizes and refines the analysis by Barbour and Hall (1984), based on the Chen-Stein method for the Poisson approximation. A new lower bound on the relative entropy between these two distributions is introduced, and this lower bound is compared to a previously reported upper bound on the relative entropy by Kontoyiannis et al. (2005). The derivation of the new lower bound on the relative entropy follows from the new lower bound on the total variation distance, combined with a distribution-dependent refinement of Pinsker's inequality by Ordentlich and Weinberger (2005). Upper and lower bounds on the Bhattacharyya parameter, Chernoff information and Hellinger distance between the distribution of the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables and the Poisson distribution with the same mean are derived as well via some relations between these quantities with the total variation distance and the relative entropy. The analysis in this work combines elements of information theory with the Chen-Stein method for the Poisson approximation. The resulting bounds are easy to compute, and their applicability is exemplified.},

abstract = {A frequent matter of debate in Bayesian inversion is the question, which of the two principle point-estimators, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or the conditional mean (CM) estimate is to be preferred. As the MAP estimate corresponds to the solution given by variational regularization techniques, this is also a constant matter of debate between the two research areas. Following a theoretical argument - the Bayes cost formalism - the CM estimate is classically preferred for being the Bayes estimator for the mean squared error cost while the MAP estimate is classically discredited for being only asymptotically the Bayes estimator for the uniform cost function. In this article we present recent theoretical and computational observations that challenge this point of view, in particular for high-dimensional sparsity-promoting Bayesian inversion. Using Bregman distances, we present new, proper convex Bayes cost functions for which the MAP estimator is the Bayes estimator. We complement this finding by results that correct further common misconceptions about MAP estimates. In total, we aim to rehabilitate MAP estimates in linear inverse problems with log-concave priors as proper Bayes estimators.},

We use \$\backslash bar\{\backslash mu\}\$ to introduce a secondary exterior product in the Borel equivariant homology and a secondary intersection product in the Borel equivariant homology of \$M\$. These secondary products generalize the product in the homology of \$BG\$ defined by Kreck which was shown to coincide with the product in negative Tate cohomology in the case where \$G\$ is finite.

abstract = {The problem of maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of discrete tree-structured distributions is considered. Chow and Liu established that ML-estimation reduces to the construction of a maximum-weight spanning tree using the empirical mutual information quantities as the edge weights. Using the theory of large-deviations, we analyze the exponent associated with the error probability of the event that the ML-estimate of the Markov tree structure differs from the true tree structure, given a set of independently drawn samples. By exploiting the fact that the output of ML-estimation is a tree, we establish that the error exponent is equal to the exponential rate of decay of a single dominant crossover event. We prove that in this dominant crossover event, a non-neighbor node pair replaces a true edge of the distribution that is along the path of edges in the true tree graph connecting the nodes in the non-neighbor pair. Using ideas from Euclidean information theory, we then analyze the scenario of ML-estimation in the very noisy learning regime and show that the error exponent can be approximated as a ratio, which is interpreted as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for learning tree distributions. We show via numerical experiments that in this regime, our SNR approximation is accurate.},

abstract = {Although extensively investigated, the capacity of the two-hop half-duplex (HD) relay channel is not fully understood. In particular, a capacity expression which can be easily evaluated is not available and an explicit coding scheme which achieves the capacity is not known either. In this paper, we derive a new expression for the capacity of the two-hop HD relay channel by simplifying previously derived converse expressions. Compared to previous results, the new capacity expression can be easily evaluated. Moreover, we propose an explicit coding scheme which achieves the capacity. To achieve the capacity, the relay does not only send information to the destination by transmitting information-carrying symbols but also with the zero symbols resulting from the relay's silence during reception. As examples, we compute the capacities of the two-hop HD relay channel for the cases when the source-relay and relay-destination links are both binary-symmetric channels (BSCs) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, respectively, and numerically compare the capacities with the rates achieved by conventional relaying where the relay receives and transmits in a codeword-by-codeword fashion and switches between reception and transmission in a strictly alternating manner. Our numerical results show that the capacities of the two-hop HD relay channel for BSC and AWGN links are significantly larger than the rates achieved with conventional relaying.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fast and robust algorithm for trend filtering, a recently developed nonparametric regression tool. It has been shown that, for estimating functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation, trend filtering achieves the minimax optimal error rate, while other popular methods like smoothing splines and kernels do not. Standing in the way of a more widespread practical adoption, however, is a lack of scalable and numerically stable algorithms for fitting trend filtering estimates. This paper presents a highly efficient, specialized ADMM routine for trend filtering. Our algorithm is competitive with the specialized interior point methods that are currently in use, and yet is far more numerically robust. Furthermore, the proposed ADMM implementation is very simple, and importantly, it is flexible enough to extend to many interesting related problems, such as sparse trend filtering and isotonic trend filtering. Software for our method is freely available, in both the C and R languages.},

abstract = {Consider a Gaussian relay network where a source node communicates to a destination node with the help of several layers of relays. Recent work has shown that compress-and-forward based strategies can achieve the capacity of this network within an additive gap. Here, the relays quantize their received signals at the noise level and map them to random Gaussian codebooks. The resultant gap to capacity is independent of the SNRs of the channels in the network and the topology but is linear in the total number of nodes.   In this paper, we provide an improved lower bound on the rate achieved by compress-and-forward based strategies (noisy network coding in particular) in arbitrary Gaussian relay networks, whose gap to capacity depends on the network not only through the total number of nodes but also through the degrees of freedom of the min cut of the network. We illustrate that for many networks, this refined lower bound can lead to a better approximation of the capacity. In particular, we demonstrate that it leads to a logarithmic rather than linear capacity gap in the total number of nodes for certain classes of layered networks. The improvement comes from quantizing the received signals of the relays at a resolution decreasing with the total number of nodes in the network. This suggests that the rule-of-thumb in literature of quantizing the received signals at the noise level can be highly suboptimal.},

@article{Mantzel2011,
abstract = {Source localization by matched-field processing (MFP) generally involves solving a number of computationally intensive partial differential equations. This paper introduces a technique that mitigates this computational workload by "compressing" these computations. Drawing on key concepts from the recently developed field of compressed sensing, it shows how a low-dimensional proxy for the Green's function can be constructed by backpropagating a small set of random receiver vectors. Then, the source can be located by performing a number of "short" correlations between this proxy and the projection of the recorded acoustic data in the compressed space. Numerical experiments in a Pekeris ocean waveguide are presented which demonstrate that this compressed version of MFP is as effective as traditional MFP even when the compression is significant. The results are particularly promising in the broadband regime where using as few as two random backpropagations per frequency performs almost as well as the traditional broadband MFP, but with the added benefit of generic applicability. That is, the computationally intensive backpropagations may be computed offline independently from the received signals, and may be reused to locate any source within the search grid area.},

@article{Lehners2015,
abstract = {This paper investigates the manner in which classical universes are obtained in the no-boundary quantum state. In this context, universes can be characterised as classical (in a WKB sense) when the wavefunction is highly oscillatory, i.e. when the ratio of the change in the amplitude of the wavefunction becomes small compared to the change in the phase. In the presence of a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied in proportion to a factor \$e\^{}\{-(\backslash epsilon - 3)N/(\backslash epsilon -1)\},\$ where \$\backslash epsilon\$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and \$N\$ designates the number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in \$N\$, but only when \$\backslash epsilon < 1\$ (inflation) or \$\backslash epsilon > 3\$ (ekpyrosis). Furthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over into a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to that point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential, where a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form \$-\backslash phi\^{}n\$ (with \$n=4,6,8\$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly kinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then quickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis, which are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share the perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time classical in the first place.},

It is critical to develop more energy-efficient systems in order to reduce the potential harmful effects to the environment.

In this paper, we propose a binary Social Spider Algorithm to give guidelines for selecting base stations to switch off. In our implementation, we use a penalty function to formulate the problem and manage to bypass the large number of constraints in the original optimization problem.

You may know the probability distributions of x and p individually but the joint distribution makes no physical sense. Yet Wigner exhibited such a joint distribution f(x,p). There was, however, a little trouble with it: some of its values were negative. Nevertheless Wigner's discovery attracted attention and found applications. There are other joint distribution, all with negative values, which produce the correct marginal distributions of x and p. But only Wigner's distribution produces the correct marginal distributions for all linear combinations of position and momentum.

There is also evidence of sub-clustering seen in the spatial distributions of young stars and of gas and dust.   Near- and mid-infrared photometry indicates that the stars exhibit colours compatible with reddening by interstellar and circumstellar dust and are likely to be low- and intermediate-mass YSOs with a large proportion of Class I YSOs.   Ammonia and CO lines were detected, with the CO emission well centred near the position of the richest part of the cluster.

It first presents a novel CGS algorithm that balances the time complexity, model accuracy and parallelization flexibility. The input corpus in zenLDA is represented as a directed graph and model parameters are annotated as the corresponding vertex attributes. The distributed training is parallelized by partitioning the graph that in each iteration it first applies CGS step for all partitions in parallel, followed by synchronizing the computed model each other. In this way, both data parallelism and model parallelism are achieved by converting them to graph parallelism. We revisited the tradeoff between system efficiency and model accuracy and presented approximations such as unsynchronized model, sparse model initialization and "converged" token exclusion. zenLDA is built on GraphX in Spark that provides distributed data abstraction (RDD) and expressive APIs to simplify the programming efforts and simultaneously hides the system complexities. This enables us to implement other CGS algorithm with a few lines of code change. To better fit in distributed data-parallel framework and achieve comparable performance with contemporary systems, we also presented several system level optimizations to push the performance limit. zenLDA was evaluated it against web-scale corpus, and the result indicates that zenLDA can achieve about much better performance than other CGS algorithm we implemented, and simultaneously achieve better model accuracy.},

abstract = {Traditionally, stochastic approximation schemes for SVIs have relied on strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian properties of the underlying map. In contrast, we consider monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems where the strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian assumptions on the mappings are weakened. In the first part of the paper, to address such shortcomings, a regularized smoothed SA (RSSA) scheme is developed wherein the stepsize, smoothing, and regularization parameters are diminishing sequences updated after every iteration. Under suitable assumptions on the sequences, we show that the algorithm generates iterates that converge to a solution in an almost sure sense, extending the results in [16] to the non-Lipschitzian regime. Motivated by the need to develop non-asymptotic rate statements, in the second part of the paper, we develop a variant of the RSSA scheme, denoted by aRSSA\$\_r\$, in which we employ a weighted iterate-averaging, parametrized by a scalar \$r\$ where \$r = 1\$ provides us with the standard averaging scheme. We make several contributions in this context: First, we show that the gap function associated with the sequences by the aRSSA\$\_r\$ scheme tends to zero when the parameter sequences are chosen appropriately. Second, we show that the gap function associated with the averaged sequence diminishes to zero at the optimal rate \$\backslash cal\{O\}(1/\backslash sqrt\{K\})\$ after \$K\$ steps when smoothing and regularization are suppressed and \$r < 1\$, thus improving the rate statement for the standard averaging which admits a rate of \$\backslash cal\{O\}(\backslash ln(K)/\backslash sqrt\{K\})\$. Third, we develop a window-based variant of this scheme that also displays the optimal rate for \$r < 1\$. Notably, we prove the superiority of the scheme with \$r < 1\$ with its counterpart with \$r=1\$ in terms of the constant factor of the error bound when the size of the averaging window is sufficiently large.},

abstract = {Subspace-based signal processing has a rich history in the literature. Traditional focus in this direction has been on problems involving a few subspaces. But a number of problems in different application areas have emerged in recent years that involve significantly larger number of subspaces relative to the ambient dimension. It becomes imperative in such settings to first identify a smaller set of active subspaces that contribute to the observations before further information processing tasks can be carried out. We term this problem of identification of a small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a single (noisy) observation in the ambient space as subspace unmixing. In this paper, we formally pose the subspace unmixing problem, discuss its connections with problems in wireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and compressed sensing, and propose and analyze a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal subspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing. The MSD algorithm turns the subspace unmixing problem into a multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) problem and our analysis helps control the family-wise error rate of this MHT problem at any level. Some other highlights of our analysis of the MSD algorithm include: (i) it is applicable to an arbitrary collection of subspaces on the Grassmann manifold; (ii) it relies on properties of the collection of subspaces that are computable in polynomial time; and (iii) it allows for linear scaling of the number of active subspaces as a function of the ambient dimension. Finally, we also present numerical results in the paper to better understand the performance of the MSD algorithm.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for the acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated by just K << N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K)) measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant signal models - wavelet trees and block sparsity - into two state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M=O(K) measurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and applicability of our new theory and algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper we derive information theoretic performance bounds to sensing and reconstruction of sparse phenomena from noisy projections. We consider two settings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and input noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider two types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared errors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, \$m\$, and \$\backslash snr\$, to signal sparsity, \$k\$, distortion level, \$d\$, and signal dimension, \$n\$. We consider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations of Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of measurements and \$\backslash snr\$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient conditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel superposition property. In particular this property implies that small support errors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not suffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of max-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise models we show that asymptotically an \$\backslash snr\$ of \$\backslash Theta(\backslash log(n))\$ together with \$\backslash Theta(k \backslash log(n/k))\$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact support recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be tolerated, a constant \$\backslash snr\$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity regime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails if the number of measurements scales as \$o(n\backslash log(n)/SNR)\$ implying poor compression performance for such cases. We also consider Bayesian set-up and characterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of measurements using rate-distortion theory.},

abstract = {We study the 2D linear stability analysis of a deformable solid of a finite height \$H\$, steadily sliding on top of a rigid solid within a generic rate-and-state friction type constitutive framework, fully accounting for elastodynamic effects. We derive the linear stability spectrum, quantifying the interplay between stabilization related to the frictional constitutive law and destabilization related both to the elastodynamic bi-material coupling between normal stress variations and interfacial slip, and to finite size effects. The stabilizing effects related to the frictional constitutive law include velocity-strengthening friction (i.e.\~{}an increase in frictional resistance with increasing slip velocity, both instantaneous and under steady-state conditions) and a regularized response to normal stress variations. We first consider the small wave-number \$k\$ limit and demonstrate that homogeneous sliding in this case is universally unstable, independently of the details of the friction law. This universal instability is mediated by propagating waveguide-like modes, whose fastest growing mode is characterized by a wave-number satisfying \$k H\backslash!\backslash sim\backslash!\{\backslash cal O\}(1)\$ and by a growth rate that scales with \$H\^{}\{-1\}\$. We then consider the limit \$k H\backslash!\backslash to\backslash!\backslash infty\$ and derive the stability phase diagram in this case. We show that the dominant instability mode travels at nearly the dilatational wave-speed in the opposite direction to the sliding direction. Instability modes which travel at nearly the shear wave-speed in the sliding direction also exist in some range of physical parameters. Finally, we show that a finite-time regularized response to normal stress variations, within the framework of generalized rate-and-state friction models, tends to promote stability.},

abstract = {Discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) relies on predictive models for characteristic features from miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The short length of miRNA genes and the lack of pronounced sequence features complicate this task. To accommodate the peculiarities of plant and animal miRNAs systems, tools for both systems have evolved differently. However, these tools are biased towards the species for which they were primarily developed and, consequently, their predictive performance on data sets from other species of the same kingdom might be lower. While these biases are intrinsic to the species, the characterization of their occurrence can lead to computational approaches able to diminish their negative effect on the accuracy of pre-miRNAs predictive models. Here, we investigate in this study how 45 predictive models induced for data sets from 45 species, distributed in eight subphyla, perform when applied to a species different from the species used in its induction. Our computational experiments show that the separability of pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre-miRNAs instances is species-dependent and no feature set performs well for all species, even within the same subphylum. Mitigating this species dependency, we show that an ensemble of classifiers reduced the classification errors for all 45 species. As the ensemble members were obtained using meaningful, and yet computationally viable feature sets, the ensembles also have a lower computational cost than individual classifiers that rely on energy stability parameters, which are of prohibitive computational cost in large scale applications. In this study, the combination of multiple pre-miRNAs feature sets and multiple learning biases enhanced the predictive accuracy of pre-miRNAs classifiers of 45 species. This is certainly a promising approach to be incorporated in miRNA discovery tools towards more accurate and less species-dependent tools.},

abstract = {With the advent of ubiquitous computing there are two design parameters of wireless communication devices that become very important power: efficiency and production cost. Compressive sensing enables the receiver in such devices to sample below the Shannon-Nyquist sampling rate, which may lead to a decrease in the two design parameters. This paper investigates the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) in a general Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) receiver. We show that when using spread spectrum codes in the signal domain, the CS measurement matrix may be simplified. This measurement scheme, named Compressive Spread Spectrum (CSS), allows for a simple, effective receiver design. Furthermore, we numerically evaluate the proposed receiver in terms of bit error rate under different signal to noise ratio conditions and compare it with other receiver structures. These numerical experiments show that though the bit error rate performance is degraded by the subsampling in the CS-enabled receivers, this may be remedied by including quantization in the receiver model. We also study the computational complexity of the proposed receiver design under different sparsity and measurement ratios. Our work shows that it is possible to subsample a CDMA signal using CSS and that in one example the CSS receiver outperforms the classical receiver.},

The test is yielded by a solution to a convex programming problem, so that our construction admits computationally efficient implementation.

abstract = {Compressed sensing aims to undersample certain high-dimensional signals yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics. Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization, which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization. We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true sparsity-undersampling tradeoff. There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based on random convex polytopes and this apparently very different theoretical formalism.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of archival Chandra observations of the mixed-morphology remnant 3C400.2. We analysed spectra of different parts of the remnant to observe if the plasma properties provide hints on the origin of the mixed-morphology class. These remnants often show overionization, which is a sign of rapid cooling of the thermal plasma, and super-solar abundances of elements which is a sign of ejecta emission. Our analysis shows that the thermal emission of 3C400.2 can be well explained by a two component non-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a high temperature (\$kT \backslash approx 3.9\$ keV) and super-solar abundances, while the other component has a much lower temperature (\$kT \backslash approx 0.14\$ keV), solar abundances and shows signs of overionization. The temperature structure, abundance values and density contrast between the different model components suggest that the hot component comes from ejecta plasma, while the cooler component has an interstellar matter origin. This seems to be the first instance of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova remnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In addition, the non-ionization equilibrium plasma component associated with the ejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the cooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore our data can most naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer parts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept up high density ISM, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low density of the plasma. This is also known as the relic X-ray scenario.},

A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

@article{Wimalajeewa2013,
abstract = {We address the problem of joint sparsity pattern recovery based on low dimensional multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) in resource constrained distributed networks. We assume that distributed nodes observe sparse signals which share the same sparsity pattern and each node obtains measurements via a low dimensional linear operator. When the measurements are collected at distributed nodes in a communication network, it is often required that joint sparse recovery be performed under inherent resource constraints such as communication bandwidth and transmit/processing power.   We present two approaches to take the communication constraints into account while performing common sparsity pattern recovery. First, we explore the use of a shared multiple access channel (MAC) in forwarding observations residing at each node to a fusion center. With MAC, while the bandwidth requirement does not depend on the number of nodes, the fusion center has access to only a linear combination of the observations. We discuss the conditions under which the common sparsity pattern can be estimated reliably. Second, we develop two collaborative algorithms based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), to jointly estimate the common sparsity pattern in a decentralized manner with a low communication overhead. In the proposed algorithms, each node exploits collaboration among neighboring nodes by sharing a small amount of information for fusion at different stages in estimating the indices of the true support in a greedy manner. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated via simulations along with a comparison with the most related existing algorithms considering the trade-off between the performance gain and the communication overhead.},

abstract = {In decentralized consensus optimization, a connected network of agents collaboratively minimize the sum of their local objective functions over a common decision variable, where their information exchange is restricted between the neighbors. To this end, one can first obtain a problem reformulation and then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The method applies iterative computation at the individual agents and information exchange between the neighbors. This approach has been observed to converge quickly and deemed powerful. This paper establishes its linear convergence rate for decentralized consensus optimization problem with strongly convex local objective functions. The theoretical convergence rate is explicitly given in terms of the network topology, the properties of local objective functions, and the algorithm parameter. This result is not only a performance guarantee but also a guideline toward accelerating the ADMM convergence.},

abstract = {Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y = Ax with known y and d x n matrix A. We seek the nonnegative x with the fewest nonzeros satisfying y = Ax. In general, this problem is NP-hard. However, for many matrices A there is a threshold phenomenon: if the sparsest solution is sufficiently sparse, it can be found by linear programming. We explain this by the theory of convex polytopes. Let a(j) denote the jth column of A, 1 < or = j < or = n, let a0 = 0 and P denote the convex hull of the a(j). We say the polytope P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices not including 0 spans a face of P. We show that outward k-neighborliness is equivalent to the statement that, whenever y = Ax has a nonnegative solution with at most k nonzeros, it is the nonnegative solution to y = Ax having minimal sum. We also consider weak neighborliness, where the overwhelming majority of k-sets of a(j)s not containing 0 span a face of P. This implies that most nonnegative vectors x with k nonzeros are uniquely recoverable from y = Ax by linear programming. Numerous corollaries follow by invoking neighborliness results. For example, for most large n by 2n underdetermined systems having a solution with fewer nonzeros than roughly half the number of equations, the sparsest solution can be found by linear programming.},

abstract = {Dynamic texture and scene classification are two fundamental problems in understanding natural video content. Extracting robust and effective features is a crucial step towards solving these problems. However the existing approaches suffer from the sensitivity to either varying illumination, or viewpoint changing, or even camera motion, and/or the lack of spatial information. Inspired by the success of deep structures in image classification, we attempt to leverage a deep structure to extract feature for dynamic texture and scene classification. To tackle with the challenges in training a deep structure, we propose to transfer some prior knowledge from image domain to video domain. To be specific, we propose to apply a well-trained Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) as a mid-level feature extractor to extract features from each frame, and then form a representation of a video by concatenating the first and the second order statistics over the mid-level features. We term this two-level feature extraction scheme as a Transferred ConvNet Feature (TCoF). Moreover we explore two different implementations of the TCoF scheme, i.e., the $\backslash$textit\{spatial\} TCoF and the $\backslash$textit\{temporal\} TCoF, in which the mean-removed frames and the difference between two adjacent frames are used as the inputs of the ConvNet, respectively. We evaluate systematically the proposed spatial TCoF and the temporal TCoF schemes on three benchmark data sets, including DynTex, YUPENN, and Maryland, and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields superior performance.},

abstract = {An efficient method is proposed for refining GPS-acquired location coordinates in urban areas using camera images, Google Street View (GSV) and sensor parameters. The main goal is to compensate for GPS location imprecision in dense area of cities due to proximity to walls and buildings. Avail-able methods for better localization often use visual information by using query images acquired with camera-equipped mobile devices and applying image retrieval techniques to find the closest match in a GPS-referenced image data set. The search areas required for reliable search are about 1-2 sq. Km and the accuracy is typically 25-100 meters. Here we describe a method based on image retrieval where a reliable search can be confined to areas of 0.01 sq. Km and the accuracy in our experiments is less than 10 meters. To test our procedure we created a database by acquiring all Google Street View images close to what is seen by a pedestrian in a large region of downtown Chicago and saved all coordinates and orientation data to be used for confining our search region. Prior knowledge from approximate position of query image is leveraged to address complexity and accuracy issues of our search in a large scale geo-tagged data set. One key aspect that differentiates our work is that it utilizes the sensor information of GPS SOS and the camera orientation in improving localization. Finally we demonstrate retrieval-based technique are less accurate in sparse open areas compared with purely GPS measurement. The effectiveness of our approach is discussed in detail and experimental results show improved performance when compared with regular approaches.},

abstract = {The late time optical and near-IR line profiles of many core-collapse supernovae exhibit a red-blue asymmetry as a result of greater extinction by internal dust of radiation emitted from the receding parts of the supernova ejecta. We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust on the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the masses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al. (1989), the presence of an extended red scattering wing in late-time line profiles can also indicate dust formation. We find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily be flux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always be blue-shifted. We have collated optical spectra of SN 1987A from a variety of archival sources and have modelled the evolution of the H\$\backslash alpha\$ line from days 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [OI] 6300,6363A doublet between days 714 and 1478. A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we find that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than smoothly distributed dust models. Our line profile fits imply day 714 dust masses of <3 \$\backslash times\$ 10\$\^{}\{-3\}\$ M\$\_\{\backslash odot\}\$ for all grain types apart from very high albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07M\$\_\{\backslash odot\}\$ can be accommodated. Large grain radii (>0.6\$\backslash mu\$m) are generally required to fit the line profiles even at the earlier epochs. We find that a large dust mass (>0.1M\$\_\{\backslash odot\}\$) had formed by day 3604 and infer that the majority of the present dust mass must have formed after this epoch. Our findings agree with recent estimates from SED fits for the dust mass evolution of SN 1987A and support the inference that the majority of SN 1987A's dust formed many years after the initial explosion.},

This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems.

Specifically, the models today often include higher order interactions, flexible connectivity structures, large la$\backslash$-bel-spaces of different cardinalities, or learned energy tables. To reflect these changes, we provide a modernized and enlarged study. We present an empirical comparison of 32 state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a corpus of 2,453 energy minimization instances from diverse applications in computer vision. To ensure reproducibility, we evaluate all methods in the OpenGM 2 framework and report extensive results regarding runtime and solution quality. Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied. However, on new and challenging types of models our findings disagree and suggest that polyhedral methods and integer programming solvers are competitive in terms of runtime and solution quality over a large range of model types.},

There is a belief that two recently proposed solutions, based on kernels and distances between pairs of points, behave well in high-dimensional settings. We identify different sources of misconception that give rise to the above belief. Specifically, we differentiate the hardness of estimation of test statistics from the hardness of testing whether these statistics are zero or not, and explicitly discuss a notion of "fair" alternative hypotheses for these problems as dimension increases. We then demonstrate that the power of these tests actually drops polynomially with increasing dimension against fair alternatives. We end with some theoretical insights and shed light on the $\backslash$textit\{median heuristic\} for kernel bandwidth selection. Our work advances the current understanding of the power of modern nonparametric hypothesis tests in high dimensions.},

In this paper we attempt to lay out such a basic mechanism, namely intrinsic plasticity. Important empirical observations with theoretical significance are time-layering of neural plasticity mediated by additional constraints to enter into later stages, various manifestations of intrinsic neural properties, and conditional gating of synaptic connections. An important consequence of the proposed mechanism is that it can explain the usually latent nature of memories.},

The idea of interference alignment is to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at the receivers, facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques.

This article provides an overview of the concept of interference alignment as well as an assessment of practical issues including performance in realistic propagation environments, the role of channel state information at the transmitter, and the practicality of interference alignment in large networks.},

All of these newly confirmed planetary systems have orbital periods that place them near first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs), including 6 systems near the 2:1 MMR, 5 near 3:2, and one each near 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5. In addition, several unconfirmed planet candidates exist in some systems (that cannot be confirmed with this method at this time). A few of these candidates would also be near first order MMRs with either the confirmed planets or with other candidates. One system of particular interest, Kepler-56 (KOI-1241), is a pair of planets orbiting a 12th magnitude, giant star with radius over three times that of the Sun and effective temperature of 4900 K---among the largest stars known to host a transiting exoplanetary system.},

The Glauber dynamics is a Markov chain that sequentially updates individual nodes (variables) in a graphical model and it is frequently used to sample from the stationary distribution (to which it converges given sufficient time). Additionally, the Glauber dynamics is a natural dynamical model in a variety of settings. This work deviates from the standard formulation of graphical model learning in the literature, where one assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution.   Much of the research on graphical model learning has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost. As the main result of this work, we establish that the problem of reconstructing binary pairwise graphical models is computationally tractable when we observe the Glauber dynamics. Specifically, we show that a binary pairwise graphical model on \$p\$ nodes with maximum degree \$d\$ can be learned in time \$f(d)p\^{}2\backslash log p\$, for a function \$f(d)\$, using nearly the information-theoretic minimum number of samples.},

abstract = {This paper considers the communication and storage costs of emulating atomic (linearizable) multi-writer multi-reader shared memory in distributed message-passing systems. The paper contains three main contributions: (1) We present a atomic shared-memory emulation algorithm that we call Coded Atomic Storage (CAS). This algorithm uses erasure coding methods. In a storage system with \$N\$ servers that is resilient to \$f\$ server failures, we show that the communication cost of CAS is \$\backslash frac\{N\}\{N-2f\}\$. The storage cost of CAS is unbounded. (2) We present a modification of the CAS algorithm known as CAS with Garbage Collection (CASGC). The CASGC algorithm is parametrized by an integer \$\backslash delta\$ and has a bounded storage cost. We show that in every execution where the number of write operations that are concurrent with a read operation is no bigger than \$\backslash delta\$, the CASGC algorithm with parameter \$\backslash delta\$ satisfies atomicity and liveness. We explicitly characterize the storage cost of CASGC, and show that it has the same communication cost as CAS. (3) We describe an algorithm known as the Communication Cost Optimal Atomic Storage (CCOAS) algorithm that achieves a smaller communication cost than CAS and CASGC. In particular, CCOAS incurs read and write communication costs of \$\backslash frac\{N\}\{N-f\}\$ measured in terms of number of object values. We also discuss drawbacks of CCOAS as compared with CAS and CASGC.},

abstract = {Morphing is the process of changing one figure into another. Some numerical methods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are shown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann conformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the Riemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D surfaces can be linked through the M$\backslash$"obius transformation due to the conformal characteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface deformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual parameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks. In this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D surfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the Riemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric domains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors for each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D deformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and Yau. Furthermore, by composition of the M$\backslash$"obius transformation and the 3D deformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean curvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the cubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.},

abstract = {Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. The common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case, compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a satisfying solution.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. The method formally discretizes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid. Operations are limited to a finite computational domain through a lattice Green's function technique. This technique obtains solutions to inhomogeneous difference equations through the discrete convolution of source terms with the fundamental solutions of the discrete operators. The differential algebraic equations describing the temporal evolution of the discrete momentum equation and incompressibility constraint are numerically solved by combining an integrating factor technique for the viscous term and a half-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the convective term. A projection method that exploits the mimetic and commutativity properties of the discrete operators is used to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises in each stage of the time integration scheme. Linear complexity, fast computation rates, and parallel scalability are achieved using recently developed fast multipole methods for difference equations. The accuracy and physical fidelity of solutions is verified through numerical simulations of vortex rings.},

This model is very generic and finds many applications in computer systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems and robotics. Special cases of the introduced network include well-known polling models and tandem queues. We derive exact limits of the mean delays under both heavy-traffic and light-traffic conditions.

For high-dimensional minimization problems involving large datasets or many unknowns, the forward-backward splitting method provides a simple, practical solver. Despite its apparently simplicity, the performance of the forward-backward splitting is highly sensitive to implementation details.   This article is an introductory review of forward-backward splitting with a special emphasis on practical implementation concerns. Issues like stepsize selection, acceleration, stopping conditions, and initialization are considered. Numerical experiments are used to compare the effectiveness of different approaches.   Many variations of forward-backward splitting are implemented in the solver FASTA (short for Fast Adaptive Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm). FASTA provides a simple interface for applying forward-backward splitting to a broad range of problems.},

In particular, the full phase-space is given for the case in which the model parameters are taken to be n=1, c1=1, and several stable de Sitter equilibrium points together with an unstable "matter-like" point are identified. We find that if the cosmological parameters are chosen to take on their Lambda CDM values today, this results in a universe which, until very low redshifts, is dominated by an equation of state parameter equal t1/3, leading to an expansion history very different from Lambda CDM. We demonstrate that this problem can be resolved by choosing Lambda CDM initial conditions at high redshifts and integrating the equations to the present day.},

abstract = {In this paper, we improve iterative greedy search algorithms in which atoms are selected serially over iterations, i.e., one-by-one over iterations. For serial atom selection, we devise two new schemes to select an atom from a set of potential atoms in each iteration. The two new schemes lead to two new algorithms. For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential atoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we propose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of potential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look ahead strategy such that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on the future iterations. The use of look ahead strategy requires a higher computational resource. To achieve a trade-off between performance and complexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new algorithm. Through experimental evaluations, we compare the proposed algorithms with existing greedy search and convex relaxation algorithms.},

abstract = {Superbubbles and supershells are the channels for transferring mass and energy from the Galactic disk to the halo. Magnetic fields are believed to play a vital role in their evolution. We study the radio continuum and polarized emission properties of the W4 superbubble to determine its magnetic field strength. New sensitive radio continuum observations were made at 6 cm, 11 cm, and 21 cm. The total intensity measurements were used to derive the radio spectrum of the W4 superbubble. The linear polarization data were analysed to determine the magnetic field properties within the bubble shells. The observations show a multi-shell structure of the W4 superbubble. A flat radio continuum spectrum that stems from optically thin thermal emission is derived from 1.4 GHz to 4.8 GHz. By fitting a passive Faraday screen model and considering the filling factor fne , we obtain the thermal electron density ne = 1.0/$\backslash$sqrt\{fne\} ($\backslash$pm5\%) cm\^{}-3 and the strength of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field B// = -5.0/$\backslash$sqrt\{fne\} ($\backslash$pm10\%) \{$\backslash$mu\}G (i.e. pointing away from us) within the western shell of the W4 superbubble. When the known tilted geometry of the W4 superbubble is considered, the total magnetic field Btot in its western shell is greater than 12 \{$\backslash$mu\}G. The electron density and the magnetic field are lower and weaker in the high-latitude parts of the superbubble. The rotation measure is found to be positive in the eastern shell but negative in the western shell of the W4 superbubble, which is consistent with the case that the magnetic field in the Perseus arm is lifted up from the plane towards high latitudes. The magnetic field strength and the electron density we derived for the W4 superbubble are important parameters for evolution models of superbubbles breaking out of the Galactic plane.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity present in many signals to reduce the number of measurements needed for digital acquisition. With this reduction would come, in theory, commensurate reductions in the size, weight, power consumption, and/or monetary cost of both signal sensors and any associated communication links. This paper examines the use of CS in the design of a wideband radio receiver in a noisy environment. We formulate the problem statement for such a receiver and establish a reasonable set of requirements that a receiver should meet to be practically useful. We then evaluate the performance of a CS-based receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of its expected performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic range, and via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance expected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show that CS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired measurements are somewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3dB SNR loss per octave of subsampling, which parallels the classic noise-folding phenomenon. On the other hand, we demonstrate that since they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems can potentially attain a significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude that while a CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some restrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that make it highly desirable in a number of important practical settings.},

abstract = {Gravitational and electromagnetic fields of an electron correspond to over-rotating Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, which has a naked singular ring and two-sheeted topology. This solution is regularized by a solitonic source, in which singular interior is replaced by a vacuum bubble filled by the Higgs field in a false-vacuum state. Field model of this KN bubble has much in common with the famous MIT and SLAC bag models, but the geometry is "dual" (turned inside out), leading to consistency of the KN bag model with gravity. Similar to other bag models, the KN bag is compliant to deformations, and under rotations it takes an oblate ellipsoidal form, creating a circular string along the border. Electromagnetic excitations of the KN bag generate stringy traveling waves which deform the bag, creating a traveling singular pole, included in a general bag-string-quark complex. The dressed electron may be considered in this model as a coherent excitation of this system, confining the point-like electron (as a quark) in state of zitterbewegung.},

abstract = {The production of energetic particles in the universe remains one of the great mysteries of modern science. The mechanisms of acceleration in astrophysical sources and the details about the propagation through the galactic and extragalactic media are still to be defined. In recent years, the cosmic ray flux has been measured with high precision in the energy range from $\backslash$energy\{10\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{20.5\} by several experiments using different techniques. In some energy ranges, it has been possible to determine the flux of individual elements (hydrogen to iron nuclei). This paper explores an astrophysical scenario in which only our Galaxy and the radio galaxy Cen A produce all particles measured on Earth in the energy range from $\backslash$energy\{10\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{20.5\}. Data from AMS-02, CREAM, KASCADE, KASCADE-Grande and the Pierre Auger Observatories are considered. The model developed here is able to describe the total and individual particle flux of all experiments considered. It is shown that the theory used here is able to describe the smooth transition from space-based to ground-based measurements. The flux of each element as determined by KASCADE and KASCADE-Grande and the mass sensitivity parameter $\backslash$xmax measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above $\backslash$energyEV\{18\} are also explored within the framework of the model. The transition from $\backslash$energy\{16\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{18\} is carefully analyzed. It is shown that the data measured in this energy range suggest the existence of an extra component of cosmic rays yet to be understood.},

abstract = {We study the computational complexity of approximating the 2->q norm of linear operators (defined as ||A||\_\{2->q\} = sup\_v ||Av||\_q/||v||\_2), as well as connections between this question and issues arising in quantum information theory and the study of Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). We show the following:   1. For any constant even integer q>=4, a graph \$G\$ is a "small-set expander" if and only if the projector into the span of the top eigenvectors of G's adjacency matrix has bounded 2->q norm. As a corollary, a good approximation to the 2->q norm will refute the Small-Set Expansion Conjecture--a close variant of the UGC. We also show that such a good approximation can be obtained in exp(n\^{}(2/q)) time, thus obtaining a different proof of the known subexponential algorithm for Small Set Expansion.   2. Constant rounds of the "Sum of Squares" semidefinite programing hierarchy certify an upper bound on the 2->4 norm of the projector to low-degree polynomials over the Boolean cube, as well certify the unsatisfiability of the "noisy cube" and "short code" based instances of Unique Games considered by prior works. This improves on the previous upper bound of exp(poly log n) rounds (for the "short code"), as well as separates the "Sum of Squares"/"Lasserre" hierarchy from weaker hierarchies that were known to require omega(1) rounds.   3. We show reductions between computing the 2->4 norm and computing the injective tensor norm of a tensor, a problem with connections to quantum information theory. Three corollaries are: (i) the 2->4 norm is NP-hard to approximate to precision inverse-polynomial in the dimension, (ii) the 2->4 norm does not have a good approximation (in the sense above) unless 3-SAT can be solved in time exp(sqrt(n) polylog(n)), and (iii) known algorithms for the quantum separability problem imply a non-trivial additive approximation for the 2->4 norm.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing is a signal processing method that acquires data directly in a compressed form. This allows one to make less measurements than what was considered necessary to record a signal, enabling faster or more precise measurement protocols in a wide range of applications. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we have recently proposed in [arXiv:1109.4424] a strategy that allows compressed sensing to be performed at acquisition rates approaching to the theoretical optimal limits. In this paper, we give a more thorough presentation of our approach, and introduce many new results. We present the probabilistic approach to reconstruction and discuss its optimality and robustness. We detail the derivation of the message passing algorithm for reconstruction and expectation max- imization learning of signal-model parameters. We further develop the asymptotic analysis of the corresponding phase diagrams with and without measurement noise, for different distribution of signals, and discuss the best possible reconstruction performances regardless of the algorithm. We also present new efficient seeding matrices, test them on synthetic data and analyze their performance asymptotically.},

We used radio attenuation material, i.e. a solar filter, to prevent the saturation of the receivers. Considering the contamination from the plage by the side-lobes, we found that the brightness temperature of the umbra should be lower than that of the quiet region. This result is inconsistent with the preexisting atmospheric models. We also found that the brightness temperature distribution at millimeter range strongly corresponds to the ultraviolet (UV) continuum emission at 1700 \{$\backslash$AA\}, especially at the quiet region.},

abstract = {The task of robust linear estimation in the presence of outliers is of particular importance in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. Although the problem has been stated a few decades ago and solved using classical (considered nowadays) methods, recently it has attracted more attention in the context of sparse modeling, where several notable contributions have been made. In the present manuscript, a new approach is considered in the framework of greedy algorithms. The noise is split into two components: a) the inlier bounded noise and b) the outliers, which are explicitly modeled by employing sparsity arguments. Based on this scheme, a novel efficient algorithm (Greedy Algorithm for Robust Denoising - GARD), is derived. GARD alternates between a least square optimization criterion and an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) selection step that identifies the outliers. The case where only outliers are present has been studied separately, where bounds on the $\backslash$textit\{Restricted Isometry Property\} guarantee that the recovery of the signal via GARD is exact. Moreover, theoretical results concerning convergence as well as the derivation of error bounds in the case of additional bounded noise are discussed. Finally, we provide extensive simulations, which demonstrate the comparative advantages of the new technique.},

abstract = {The journey of the Sun through space carries the solar system through a dynamic interstellar environment that is presently characterized by Mach 1 motion between the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The interaction between the heliosphere and ISM is an evolving process due to the variable solar wind and to interstellar turbulence. Frisch et al. presented a meta-analysis of the historical data on the interstellar wind flowing through the heliosphere and concluded that temporal changes in the ecliptic longitude of the wind were statistically indicated by the data available in the refereed literature at the time of that writing. Lallement and Bertaux disagree with this result, and suggested, for instance, that a key instrumental response function of IBEX-Lo was incorrect and that the STEREO pickup ion data are unsuitable for diagnosing the flow of interstellar neutrals through the heliosphere. Here we show that temporal variations in the interstellar wind through the heliosphere are consistent with our knowledge of local ISM. The statistical analysis of the historical helium wind data is revisited, and a recent correction of a typographical error in the literature is incorporated into the new fits. With this correction, and including no newer IBEX results, these combined data still indicate that a change in the longitude of the interstellar neutral wind over the past forty years is statistically likely, but that a constant flow longitude is now also statistically possible. It is shown that the IBEX instrumental response function is known, and that the STEREO pickup ion data have been correctly utilized in this analysis.},

abstract = {The application of the lasso is espoused in high-dimensional settings where only a small number of the regression coefficients are believed to be nonzero. Moreover, statistical properties of high-dimensional lasso estimators are often proved under the assumption that the correlation between the predictors is bounded. In this vein, coordinatewise methods, the most common means of computing the lasso solution, work well in the presence of low to moderate multicollinearity. The computational speed of coordinatewise algorithms degrades however as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases. Motivated by these limitations, we propose the novel "Deterministic Bayesian Lasso" algorithm for computing the lasso solution. This algorithm is developed by considering a limiting version of the Bayesian lasso. The performance of the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso improves as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases, and can offer substantial increases in computational speed. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that (1) the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm converges to the lasso solution, and (2) it leads to a representation of the lasso estimator which shows how it achieves both \$\backslash ell\_1\$ and \$\backslash ell\_2\$ types of shrinkage simultaneously. Connections to other algorithms are also provided. The benefits of the Deterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm are then illustrated on simulated and real data.},

abstract = {A fundamental aspect of biological information processing is the ubiquity of sequence-function relationships -- functions that map the sequence of DNA, RNA, or protein to a biochemically relevant activity. Most sequence-function relationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental techniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The advent of such "massively parallel" experiments presents an exciting opportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the study of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental advances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of sequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments. Specifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that inference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based approach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these models. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of "diffeomorphic modes" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data than likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in physics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the inference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel experiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these fundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an outlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing studies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.},

Different from quantum process tomography, our scheme is fully scalable with the number of qubits as the required rounds of measurements increase only linearly with the number of coupling terms in the Hamiltonian. The scheme makes use of synchronized dynamical decoupling pulses to simplify the many-body dynamics so that the unknown parameters in the Hamiltonian can be retrieved one by one.

@article{Mo2014,
abstract = {In recent years, compressive sensing (CS) has attracted significant attention in parameter estimation tasks, including frequency estimation, time delay estimation, and localization. In order to use CS in parameter estimation, parametric dictionaries (PDs) collect observations for a sampling of the parameter space and yield sparse representations for signals of interest when the sampling is sufficiently dense. While this dense sampling can lead to high coherence in the dictionary, it is possible to leverage structured sparsity models to prevent highly coherent dictionary elements from appearing simultaneously in the signal representations, alleviating these coherence issues. However, the resulting approaches depend heavily on a careful setting of the maximum allowable coherence; furthermore, their guarantees applied on the coefficient recovery do not translate in general to the parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose the use of the earth mover's distance (EMD), as applied to a pair of true and estimated coefficient vectors, to measure the error of the parameter estimation. We formally analyze the connection between the aforementioned EMD and the parameter estimation error. We theoretically show that the EMD provides a better-suited metric for the performance of PD-based parameter estimation than the commonly used Euclidean distance. Additionally, we leverage the previously described relationship between K-median clustering and EMD-based sparse approximation to develop improved PD-based parameter estimation algorithms. Finally, we present numerical experiments that verify our theoretical results and show the performance improvements obtained from the proposed compressive parameter estimation algorithms.},

More specifically, we point out that, in general networks, the sub-critical regime behaves in \$O(\backslash sqrt\{n\})\$ where \$n\$ is the size of the network, and that this upper bound is met for star-shaped networks. We apply our results to epidemiology and percolation on arbitrary networks, and derive a bound for the critical value beyond which a giant connected component arises.

abstract = {This paper develops a new communication strategy, ergodic interference alignment, for the K-user interference channel with time-varying fading. At any particular time, each receiver will see a superposition of the transmitted signals plus noise. The standard approach to such a scenario results in each transmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional to 1/K its interference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two well-chosen time indices, the channel coefficients from interfering users can be made to exactly cancel. By adding up these two observations, each receiver can obtain its desired signal without any interference. If the channel gains have independent, uniform phases, this technique allows each user to achieve at least 1/2 its interference-free ergodic capacity at any signal-to-noise ratio. Prior interference alignment techniques were only able to attain this performance as the signal-to-noise ratio tended to infinity. Extensions are given for the case where each receiver wants a message from more than one transmitter as well as the "X channel" case (with two receivers) where each transmitter has an independent message for each receiver. Finally, it is shown how to generalize this strategy beyond Gaussian channel models. For a class of finite field interference channels, this approach yields the ergodic capacity region.},

We first consider the reconstruction of the full solution of the wave equation posed in \$\backslash Omega\backslash times (0,T)\$ - \$\backslash Omega\$ a bounded subset of \$\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}N\$ - from a partial distributed observation. We employ a least-squares technique and minimize the \$L\^{}2\$-norm of the distance from the observation to any solution. Taking the hyperbolic equation as the main constraint of the problem, the optimality conditions are reduced to a mixed formulation involving both the state to reconstruct and a Lagrange multiplier. Under usual geometric optic conditions, we show the well-posedness of this mixed formulation (in particular the inf-sup condition) and then introduce a numerical approximation based on space-time finite elements discretization. We prove the strong convergence of the approximation and then discussed several examples for \$N=1\$ and \$N=2\$. The problem of the reconstruction of both the state and the source term is also addressed.},

First, we show that it is feasible to manipulate, consistently control and stabilize the readings of different acoustic and physical environment sensors (and even multiple sensors simultaneously) using low-cost, off-the-shelf equipment. Second, based on these capabilities, we show that an attacker who can manipulate the context gains a significant advantage in defeating context-based co-presence detection. For systems that use multiple sensors, we investigate two sensor fusion approaches based on machine learning techniques: features-fusion and decisions-fusion, and show that both are vulnerable to contextual attacks but the latter approach can be more resistant in some cases.},

abstract = {The sumset and inverse sumset theories of Freiman, Pl$\backslash$"\{u\}nnecke and Ruzsa, give bounds connecting the cardinality of the sumset \$A+B=\backslash\{a+b\backslash;;\backslash;a\backslash in A,\backslash,b\backslash in B\backslash\}\$ of two discrete sets \$A,B\$, to the cardinalities (or the finer structure) of the original sets \$A,B\$. For example, the sum-difference bound of Ruzsa states that, \$|A+B|\backslash,|A|\backslash,|B|\backslash leq|A-B|\^{}3\$, where the difference set \$A-B= \backslash\{a-b\backslash;;\backslash;a\backslash in A,\backslash,b\backslash in B\backslash\}\$. Interpreting the differential entropy \$h(X)\$ of a continuous random variable \$X\$ as (the logarithm of) the size of the effective support of \$X\$, the main contribution of this paper is a series of natural information-theoretic analogs for these results. For example, the Ruzsa sum-difference bound becomes the new inequality, \$h(X+Y)+h(X)+h(Y)\backslash leq 3h(X-Y)\$, for any pair of independent continuous random variables \$X\$ and \$Y\$. Our results include differential-entropy versions of Ruzsa's triangle inequality, the Pl$\backslash$"\{u\}nnecke-Ruzsa inequality, and the Balog-Szemer$\backslash$'\{e\}di-Gowers lemma. Also we give a differential entropy version of the Freiman-Green-Ruzsa inverse-sumset theorem, which can be seen as a quantitative converse to the entropy power inequality. Versions of most of these results for the discrete entropy \$H(X)\$ were recently proved by Tao, relying heavily on a strong, functional form of the submodularity property of \$H(X)\$. Since differential entropy is \{$\backslash$em not\} functionally submodular, in the continuous case many of the corresponding discrete proofs fail, in many cases requiring substantially new proof strategies. We find that the basic property that naturally replaces the discrete functional submodularity, is the data processing property of mutual information.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

When such a measure satisfies a natural data processing property, and the random variable of interest has alphabet size greater than two, we show that it is uniquely characterized by the mutual information, and the corresponding loss function coincides with logarithmic loss. In doing so, our work provides a new characterization of mutual information, and justifies its use as a measure of relevance. When the alphabet is binary, we characterize the only admissible forms the measure of relevance can assume while obeying the specified data processing property.

Then, we propose to follow the classical approach, by plugging this estimator in the criterion used for change-point estimation, which is equivalent to decorrelate the series using the estimated autoregression parameters. We show that the asymptotic properties of these change-point location and mean estimators are the same as those of the classical estimators in the independent framework. The same plug-in approach is then used to approximate the modified BIC and choose the number of segments, and to derive a heuristic BIC criterion to select both the number of changes and the order of the autoregression. Finally, we show, in the simulation section, that for finite sample size taking into account the dependence structure improves the statistical performance of the change-point estimators and of the selection criterion.},

abstract = {The potential of compressive sensing (CS) has spurred great interest in the research community and is a fast growing area of research. However, research translating CS theory into practical hardware and demonstrating clear and significant benefits with this hardware over current, conventional imaging techniques has been limited. This article helps researchers to find those niche applications where the CS approach provides substantial gain over conventional approaches by articulating lessons learned in finding one such application; sea skimming missile detection. As a proof of concept, it is demonstrated that a simplified CS missile detection architecture and algorithm provides comparable results to the conventional imaging approach but using a smaller FPA. The primary message is that all of the excitement surrounding CS is necessary and appropriate for encouraging our creativity but we all must also take off our "rose colored glasses" and critically judge our ideas, methods and results relative to conventional imaging approaches.},

We integrate the additional knowledge of the similar signal into CS via L1-L1 and L1-L2 minimization. We then establish bounds on the number of measurements required by these problems to successfully reconstruct the original signal. Our bounds and geometrical interpretations reveal that if the prior information has good enough quality, L1-L1 minimization improves the performance of CS dramatically. In contrast, L1-L2 minimization has a performance very similar to classical CS and brings no significant benefits. All our findings are illustrated with experimental results.},

@article{Zhao2012,
abstract = {In linear regression with functional predictors and scalar responses, it may be advantageous, particularly if the function is thought to contain features at many scales, to restrict the coefficient function to the span of a wavelet basis, thereby converting the problem into one of variable selection. If the coefficient function is sparsely represented in the wavelet domain, we may employ the well-known LASSO to select a relatively small number of nonzero wavelet coefficients. This is a natural approach to take but to date, the properties of such an estimator have not been studied. In this paper we describe the wavelet-based LASSO approach to regressing scalars on functions and investigate both its asymptotic convergence and its finite-sample performance through both simulation and real-data application. We compare the performance of this approach with existing methods and find that the wavelet-based LASSO performs relatively well, particularly when the true coefficient function is spiky. Source code to implement the method and data sets used in the study are provided as supplemental materials available online.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of novel greedy techniques for distributed learning under sparsity constraints. Greedy techniques have widely been used in centralized systems due to their low computational requirements and at the same time their relatively good performance in estimating sparse parameter vectors/signals. The paper reports two new algorithms in the context of sparsity--aware learning. In both cases, the goal is first to identify the support set of the unknown signal and then to estimate the non--zero values restricted to the active support set. First, an iterative greedy multi--step procedure is developed, based on a neighborhood cooperation strategy, using batch processing on the observed data. Next, an extension of the algorithm to the online setting, based on the diffusion LMS rationale for adaptivity, is derived. Theoretical analysis of the algorithms is provided, where it is shown that the batch algorithm converges to the unknown vector if a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) holds. Moreover, the online version converges in the mean to the solution vector under some general assumptions. Finally, the proposed schemes are tested against recently developed sparsity--promoting algorithms and their enhanced performance is verified via simulation examples.},

Calculations are performed both with PBE and PBEsol exchange correlation functionals.

We then assess a potential site preference of the Fe\$\^{}\{3+\}\$ cation by comparing 10 different distributions of the perovskite \$B\$-sites. We find a slight preference for the "inner" site, consistent with recent experimental observations. We obtain a large value of \$\backslash sim\$55 \$\backslash mu\$C/cm\$\^{}2\$ for the spontaneous electric polarization, which is rather independent of the specific Fe distribution. Finally, we calculate the strength of the magnetic coupling constants and find strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe\$\^{}\{3+\}\$ cations in nearest neighbor positions, whereas the coupling between further neighbors is rather weak. This poses the question whether magnetic long range order can occur in this system in spite of the low concentration of magnetic ions.},

abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

Here we explore new connections between mutual information and regression-based dependence measures, \$\backslash nu\^{}\{-1\}\$, that utilise the determinant of the second-moment matrix of the conditional mean prediction error. We examine convergence properties as \$\backslash nu\backslash rightarrow0\$ and establish sharp lower bounds on mutual information and capacity of the form \$\backslash mathrm\{log\}(\backslash nu\^{}\{-1/2\})\$. The bounds are tighter than lower bounds based on the Pearson correlation and ones derived using average mean square-error rate distortion arguments. Furthermore, their estimation is feasible using techniques from nonparametric regression. As an illustration we provide bootstrap confidence intervals for the lower bounds which, through use of a composite estimator, substantially improve upon inference about mutual information based on \$k\$-nearest neighbour estimators alone.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the generalized forward-backward splitting algorithm for minimizing convex functions of the form \$F + \backslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}n G\_i\$, where \$F\$ has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient and the \$G\_i\$'s are simple in the sense that their Moreau proximity operators are easy to compute. While the forward-backward algorithm cannot deal with more than \$n = 1\$ non-smooth function, our method generalizes it to the case of arbitrary \$n\$. Our method makes an explicit use of the regularity of \$F\$ in the forward step, and the proximity operators of the \$G\_i\$'s are applied in parallel in the backward step. This allows the generalized forward backward to efficiently address an important class of convex problems. We prove its convergence in infinite dimension, and its robustness to errors on the computation of the proximity operators and of the gradient of \$F\$. Examples on inverse problems in imaging demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods in comparison to other splitting algorithms.},

abstract = {Massive MIMO is a promising technique to meet the exponential growth of global mobile data traffic demand. However, contrary to the current systems, energy consumption of next generation networks is required to be load adaptive as the network load varies significantly throughout the day. In this paper, we propose a load adaptive massive MIMO system that varies the number of antennas following the daily load profile (DLP) in order to maximize the downlink energy efficiency (EE). A multi-cell system is considered where each base station (BS) is equipped with a large number of antennas to serve many single antenna users. In order to incorporate DLP, each BS is modeled as an M/G/m/m state dependent queue under the assumption that the network is dimensioned to serve a maximum number of users at the peak load. For a given number of users in a cell, the optimum number of active antennas maximizing EE is derived. The EE maximization problem is formulated in a game theoretic framework where the number of antennas to be used by a BS is determined through best response iteration. This load adaptive system achieves overall 19\% higher EE compared to a baseline system where the BSs always run with the fixed number of antennas that is most energy efficient at peak load and that can be switched-off when there is no traffic},

abstract = {When and how galaxy morphology such as disk and bulge seen in the present-day universe emerged is still not clear. In the universe at \$z\backslash gtrsim 2\$, galaxies with various morphology are seen, and star-forming galaxies at \$z\backslash sim2\$ show an intrinsic shape of bar-like structure. Then, when did round disk structure form? Here we take a simple and straightforward approach to see the epoch when a round disk galaxy population emerged by constraining the intrinsic shape statistically based on apparent axial ratio distribution of galaxies. We derived the distributions of the apparent axial ratios in the rest-frame optical light (\$\backslash sim 5000\$ $\backslash$AA) of star-forming main sequence galaxies at \$2.5>z>1.4\$, \$1.4>z>0.85\$, and \$0.85>z>0.5\$, and found that the apparent axial ratios of them show peaky distributions at \$z\backslash gtrsim0.85\$, while a rather flat distribution at the lower redshift. By using a tri-axial model (\$A>B>C\$) for the intrinsic shape, we found the best-fit models give the peaks of the \$B/A\$ distribution of \$0.81\backslash pm0.04\$, \$0.84\backslash pm0.04\$, and \$0.92\backslash pm0.05\$ at \$2.5>z>1.4\$, \$1.4>z>0.85\$, and \$0.85>z>0.5\$, respectively. The last value is close to the local value of 0.95. Thickness (\$C/A\$) is \$\backslash sim0.25\$ at all the redshifts and is close to the local value (0.21). The results indicate the shape of the star-forming galaxies in the main sequence changes gradually, and the round disk is established at around \$z\backslash sim0.9\$. Establishment of the round disk may be due to a cease of violent interaction of galaxies or a growth of a bulge and/or a super-massive black hole resides at the center of a galaxy which dissolves the bar structure.},

abstract = {The Resonant Switch (RS) model of twin high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in neutron star binary systems, based on switch of the twin oscillations at a resonant point, has been applied to the atoll source 4U 1636-53 under assumption that the neutron star exterior can be approximated by the Kerr geometry. Strong restrictions of the neutron star parameters M (mass) and a (spin) arise due to fitting the frequency pairs admitted by the RS model to the observed data in the regions related to the resonant points. The most precise variants of the RS model are those combining the relativistic precession frequency relations with their modifications. Here, the neutron star mass and spin estimates given by the RS model are confronted with a variety of equations of state (EoS) governing structure of neutron stars in the framework of the Hartle-Thorne theory of rotating neutron stars applied for the observationally given rotation frequency f\_rot\~{}580 Hz (or alternatively f\_rot\~{}290 Hz) of the neutron star at 4U 1636-53. It is shown that only two variants of the RS model based on the Kerr approximation are compatible with two EoS applied in the Hartle-Thorne theory for f\_rot\~{}580 Hz, while no variant of the RS model is compatible for f\_rot\~{}290 Hz. The two compatible variants of the RS model are those giving the best fits of the observational data. However, a self-consistency test by fitting the observational data to the RS model with oscillation frequencies governed by the Hartle-Thorne geometry described by three spacetime parameters M, a and (quadrupole moment) q related by the two available EoS puts strong restrictions. The test admits only one variant of the RS model of twin HF QPOs for the Hartle-Thorne theory with the Gandolfi et al.

@article{Parno2014,
abstract = {We introduce a new framework for efficient sampling from complex probability distributions, using a combination of optimal transport maps and the Metropolis-Hastings rule. The core idea is to use continuous transportation to transform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin methods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively explore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower triangular transport map-an approximation of the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement-using information from previous MCMC states, via the solution of an optimization problem. This optimization problem is convex regardless of the form of the target distribution. It is solved efficiently using a Newton method that requires no gradient information from the target probability distribution; the target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates enable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large numbers of samples. We show that this approach uses inexact or truncated maps to produce an adaptive MCMC algorithm that is ergodic for the exact target distribution. Numerical demonstrations on a range of parameter inference problems show order-of-magnitude speedups over standard MCMC techniques, measured by the number of effectively independent samples produced per target density evaluation and per unit of wallclock time.},

abstract = {In this paper we shall re-visit the well-known Schr$\backslash$"odinger and Lindblad dynamics of quantum mechanics. However, these equations may be realized as the consequence of a more general, underlying dynamical process. In both cases we shall see that the evolution of a quantum state \$P\_\backslash psi=\backslash varrho(0)\$ has the not so well-known pseudo-quadratic form \$\backslash partial\_t\backslash varrho(t)=\backslash mathbf\{V\}\^{}\backslash star\backslash varrho(t)\backslash mathbf\{V\}\$ where \$\backslash mathbf\{V\}\$ is a vector operator in a complex Minkowski space and the pseudo-adjoint \$\backslash mathbf\{V\}\^{}\backslash star\$ is induced by the Minkowski metric \$\backslash boldsymbol\{\backslash eta\}\$. The interesting thing about this formalism is that its derivation has very deep roots in a new understanding of the differential calculus of time. This Minkowski-Hilbert representation of quantum dynamics is called the $\backslash$emph\{Belavkin Formalism\}; a beautiful, but not well understood theory of mathematical physics that understands that both deterministic and stochastic dynamics may be `unraveled' in a second-quantized Minkowski space. Working in such a space provided the author with the means to construct a QS (quantum stochastic) Duhamel principle and known applications to a Schr$\backslash$"odinger dynamics perturbed by a continual measurement process are considered. What is not known, but presented here, is the role of the Lorentz transform in quantum measurement, and the appearance of Riemannian geometry in quantum measurement is also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for linear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we propose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the supports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated across pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly distributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model through a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes into consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at least one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may exhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior probabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and, conditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the support, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable property of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters of the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting regularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed methodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with synthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the literature.},

From these timescales, we show that if the initial planetesimal disk has the semimajor axes distribution \$\{\backslash rm d\}n/\{\backslash rm d\}a\backslash propto a\^{}\{-2\}\$, which is produced by planetary scattering (Higuchi et al. 2006), the \$e\$-folding time for planetesimals in the Oort cloud is \$\backslash sim\$10 Gyr at any heliocentric distance \$r\$. This uniform \$e\$-folding time over the Oort cloud means that the supply of comets from the inner Oort cloud to the outer Oort cloud is sufficiently effective to keep the comet distribution as \$\{\backslash rm d\}n/\{\backslash rm d\}r\backslash propto r\^{}\{-2\}\$. We also show that the final distribution of the semimajor axes in the Oort cloud is approximately proportional to \$a\^{}\{-2\}\$ for any initial distribution.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new concept for constructing prior distributions. We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

abstract = {rdering of regression or classification coefficients occurs in many real-world applications. Fused Lasso exploits this ordering by explicitly regularizing the differences between neighboring coefficients through an \$\backslash ell\_1\$ norm regularizer. However, due to nonseparability and nonsmoothness of the regularization term, solving the fused Lasso problem is computationally demanding. Existing solvers can only deal with problems of small or medium size, or a special case of the fused Lasso problem in which the predictor matrix is identity matrix. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm based on split Bregman method to solve a class of large-scale fused Lasso problems, including a generalized fused Lasso and a fused Lasso support vector classifier. We derive our algorithm using augmented Lagrangian method and prove its convergence properties. The performance of our method is tested on both artificial data and real-world applications including proteomic data from mass spectrometry and genomic data from array CGH. We demonstrate that our method is many times faster than the existing solvers, and show that it is especially efficient for large p, small n problems.},

abstract = {We consider the quantitative group testing problem where the objective is to identify defective items in a given population based on results of tests performed on subsets of the population. Under the quantitative group testing model, the result of each test reveals the number of defective items in the tested group. The minimum number of tests achievable by nested test plans was established by Aigner and Schughart in 1985 within a minimax framework. The optimal nested test plan offering this performance, however, was not obtained. In this work, we establish the optimal nested test plan in closed form. This optimal nested test plan is also asymptotically (as the population size grows to infinity) optimal among all test plans. We then focus on the application of heavy hitter detection problem for traffic monitoring and anomaly detection in the Internet and other communication networks. For such applications, it is often the case that a few abnormal traffic flows with exceptionally high volume (referred to as heavy hitters) make up most of the traffic seen by the entire network. Since the volume of heavy hitters is much higher than that of normal flows, the number of heavy hitters in a group of flows can be accurately estimated from the aggregated traffic load. Other potential applications include detecting idle channels in the radio spectrum in the high SNR regime.},

The decoder (which corrects the corrupted components of y) is the metric projection onto the range of Q in the L\_1 norm. An equivalent problem arises in signal processing: how to reconstruct a signal that belongs to a small class from few linear measurements? We prove that for most sets of Gaussian measurements, all signals of small support can be exactly reconstructed by the L\_1 norm minimization. This is a substantial improvement of recent results of Donoho and of Candes and Tao. An equivalent problem in combinatorial geometry is the existence of a polytope with fixed number of facets and maximal number of lower-dimensional facets.

abstract = {Metakaolin is a broadly used industrial raw material, with applications in the production of ceramics and geopolymers, and the partial replacement of Portland cement. The early stages of the manufacturing of some of these materials require the preparation and processing of a foamed metakaolin-based slurry. In this study, we propose to investigate the rheology of a foamed metakaolin-based fresh paste by performing well-controlled experiments. We work with a non-reactive metakaolin paste containing surfactant, in which we disperse bubbles of known radius at a chosen volume fraction. We perform rheometry measurements to characterize the minimum stress required for the foamed materials to flow (yield stress), and the dissipation occurring during flow. We show that the yield stress of the foamed samples is equal to the one of the metakaolin paste, and that dissipation during flow increases quadratically with the bubble volume fraction. Comparison with yielding and flow of model foamed yield stress fluids allows us to understand these results in terms of coupling between the bubbles' surface tension and the metakaolin paste's rheology.},

abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental problem in many scientific applications. Standard methods such as \$k\$-means, Gaussian mixture models, and hierarchical clustering, however, are beset by local minima, which are sometimes drastically suboptimal. Recently introduced convex relaxations of \$k\$-means and hierarchical clustering shrink cluster centroids toward one another and ensure a unique global minimizer. In this work we present two splitting methods for solving the convex clustering problem. The first is an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); the second is an instance of the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA). In contrast to previously considered algorithms, our ADMM and AMA formulations provide simple and unified frameworks for solving the convex clustering problem under the previously studied norms and open the door to potentially novel norms. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data examples. While the differences between the two algorithms appear to be minor on the surface, complexity analysis and numerical experiments show AMA to be significantly more efficient.},

The current best upper bound in all sufficiently high dimensions is due to Kabatiansky and Levenshtein in 1978. We revisit their argument and improve their bound by a constant factor using a simple geometric argument, and we extend the argument to packings in hyperbolic space, for which it gives an exponential improvement over the previously known bounds. Additionally, we show that the Cohn-Elkies linear programming bound is always at least as strong as the Kabatiansky-Levenshtein bound; this result is analogous to Rodemich's theorem in coding theory. Finally, we develop hyperbolic linear programming bounds and prove the analogue of Rodemich's theorem there as well.},

However, only one of these structures contributes to the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor and the other one is present in those N=4 superconformal theories which are not invariant under the mirror map. We point out that general N=4 superconformal field theories admit two inequivalent flavour current multiplets and show that the three-point function of each of them is determined by one tensor structure. As an example, we compute the two- and three-point functions of the conserved currents in N=4 superconformal models of free hypermultiplets. We also derive the universal relations between the coefficients appearing in the two- and three-point correlators of the supercurrent and flavour current multiplets in all superconformal theories with N=1,2,3,4 supersymmetry. Our derivation is based on the use of Ward identities in conjunction with superspace reduction techniques.},

This article provides an introduction to Bayesian models of graphs, matrices, and other data that can be modeled by random structures.

With the basic ideas in place, we survey example models available in the literature; applications of such models include collaborative filtering, link prediction, and graph and network analysis. We also highlight connections to recent developments in graph theory and probability, and sketch the more general mathematical foundation of Bayesian methods for other types of data beyond sequences and arrays.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing is by now well-established as an effective tool for extracting sparsely distributed information, where sparsity is a discrete concept, referring to the number of dominant nonzero signal components in some basis for the signal space. In this paper, we establish a framework for estimation of continuous-valued parameters based on compressive measurements on a signal corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While standard compressed sensing based on naive discretization has been shown to suffer from performance loss due to basis mismatch, we demonstrate that this is not an inherent property of compressive measurements. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (a) We identify the isometries required to preserve fundamental estimation-theoretic quantities such as the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Under such isometries, compressive projections can be interpreted simply as a reduction in "effective SNR." (b) We show that the threshold behavior of the ZZB provides a criterion for determining the minimum number of measurements for "accurate" parameter estimation. (c) We provide detailed computations of the number of measurements needed for the isometries in (a) to hold for the problem of frequency estimation in a mixture of sinusoids. We show via simulations that the design criterion in (b) is accurate for estimating the frequency of a single sinusoid.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing aims to undersample certain high-dimensional signals yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics. Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization, which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization. We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true sparsity-undersampling tradeoff. There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based on random convex polytopes and this apparently very different theoretical formalism.},

The computational stencil of the spectral difference method is compact and advantageous for parallel processing. CHORUS demonstrates excellent parallel performance for all test cases reported in this paper, scaling up to 12,000 cores on the Yellowstone High-Performance Computing cluster at NCAR. The code is verified by defining two benchmark cases for global convection in Jupiter and the Sun. CHORUS results are compared with results from the ASH code and good agreement is found.

Although LP decoding on this polytope has the ML-certificate property, it performs poorly over a BAWGN channel. In this paper, we propose modifications to adaptive cut generation based LP decoding techniques and apply the modified-adaptive LP decoder to short blocklength polar codes over a BAWGN channel. The proposed decoder provides significant FER performance gain compared to the previously proposed LP decoder and its performance approaches that of ML decoding at high SNRs. We also present an algorithm to obtain a smaller factor graph from the original sparse factor graph of a polar code. This reduced factor graph preserves the small check node degrees needed to represent the LP polytope in practice. We show that the fundamental polytope of the reduced factor graph can be obtained from the projection of the polytope represented by the original sparse factor graph and the frozen bit information. Thus, the LP decoding time complexity is decreased without changing the FER performance by using the reduced factor graph representation.},

abstract = {Reliability prediction is an important research problem in software reliability engineering, which has been widely studied in the last decades. However, modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services remain an open problem. Software services, such as Web services and Web APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the Internet, leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g., service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by black-box services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a context-aware reliability prediction approach that leverages historical usage data from users for reliability prediction. Through context-aware model construction and prediction, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary evaluation results show that CARP can make significant improvement on reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., 41\% for MAE and 38\% for RMSE when only 5\% of data are available.},

abstract = {Developing an efficient spectrum access policy enables cognitive radios to dramatically increase spectrum utilization while ensuring predetermined quality of service levels for primary users. In this paper, modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of a distributed secondary network with random sensing order policy are studied. Specifically, the secondary users create a random order of available channels upon primary users return, and then find optimal transmission and handoff opportunities in a distributed manner. By a Markov chain analysis, the average throughputs of the secondary users and average interference level among the secondary and primary users are investigated. A maximization of the secondary network performance in terms of the throughput while keeping under control the average interference is proposed. It is shown that despite of traditional view, non-zero false alarm in the channel sensing can increase channel utilization, especially in a dense secondary network where the contention is too high. Then, two simple and practical adaptive algorithms are established to optimize the network. The second algorithm follows the variations of the wireless channels in non-stationary conditions and outperforms even static brute force optimization, while demanding few computations. The convergence of the distributed algorithms are theoretically investigated based on the analytical performance indicators established by the Markov chain analysis. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical derivations and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. It is concluded that fully distributed sensing order algorithms can lead to substantial performance improvements in cognitive radio networks without the need of centralized management or message passing among the users.},

Surprisingly, the derived communities for any self-organized and/or self-evolved large networks demonstrate very striking power laws, implying that there are far more small communities than large ones. This notion of far more small things than large ones constitutes a new fundamental way of thinking for community detection.

Traditional convex models suffer from the suboptimal performance though enjoying tractable computation. In this paper, we propose a new non-convex joint sparsity model, and develop a corresponding multi-stage adaptive convex relaxation algorithm. This method extends the idea of iterative support detection (ISD) from the single vector estimation to the multi-vector estimation by considering the joint sparsity prior. We provide some preliminary theoretical analysis including convergence analysis and a sufficient recovery condition. Numerical experiments from both compressive sensing and feature learning show the better performance of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate that the extension of ISD from the single vector to multi-vector estimation is not trivial. In particular, while ISD does not work well for reconstructing the signal channel sparse Bernoulli signal, it does achieve significantly improved performance when recovering the multi-channel sparse Bernoulli signal thanks to its ability of natural incorporation of the joint sparsity structure.},

abstract = {The permanent vs. determinant problem is one of the most important problems in theoretical computer science, and is the main target of geometric complexity theory proposed by Mulmuley and Sohoni. The current best lower bound for the determinantal complexity of the d by d permanent polynomial is d\^{}2/2, due to Mignon and Ressayre in 2004. Inspired by their proof method, we introduce a natural rank concept of polynomials, called the bi-polynomial rank. The bi-polynomial rank is related to width of an arithmetic branching program. The bi-polynomial rank of a homogeneous polynomial p of even degree 2k is defined as the minimum n such that p can be written as a summation of n products of polynomials of degree k. We prove that the bi-polynomial rank gives a lower bound of the determinantal complexity. As a consequence, the above Mignon and Ressayre bound is improved to (d-1)\^{}2 + 1 over the field of reals. We show that the computation of the bi-polynomial rank is formulated as a rank minimization problem. Applying the concave minimization technique, we reduce the problem of lower-bounding determinantal complexity to that of proving the positive semidefiniteness of matrices, and this is a new approach for the permanent vs. determinant problem. We propose a computational approach for giving a lower bound of this rank minimization, via techniques of the concave minimization. This also yields a new strategy to attack the permanent vs. determinant problem.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates how new principles of compressed sensing, namely asymptotic incoherence, asymptotic sparsity and multilevel sampling, can be utilised to better understand underlying phenomena in practical compressed sensing and improve results in real-world applications. The contribution of the paper is fourfold:   First, it explains how the sampling strategy depends not only on the signal sparsity but also on its structure, and shows how to design effective sampling strategies utilising this.   Second, it demonstrates that the optimal sampling strategy and the efficiency of compressed sensing also depends on the resolution of the problem, and shows how this phenomenon markedly affects compressed sensing results and how to exploit it.   Third, as the new framework also fits analog (infinite dimensional) models that govern many inverse problems in practice, the paper describes how it can be used to yield substantial improvements.   Fourth, by using multilevel sampling, which exploits the structure of the signal, the paper explains how one can outperform random Gaussian/Bernoulli sampling even when the classical \$l\^{}1\$ recovery algorithm is replaced by modified algorithms which aim to exploit structure such as model based or Bayesian compressed sensing or approximate message passaging. This final observation raises the question whether universality is desirable even when such matrices are applicable.   Examples of practical applications investigated in this paper include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electron Microscopy (EM), Compressive Imaging (CI) and Fluorescence Microscopy (FM). For the latter, a new compressed sensing approach is also presented.},

abstract = {A central question in optimization is to maximize (or minimize) a linear function over a given polytope P. To solve such a problem in practice one needs a concise description of the polytope P. In this paper we are interested in representations of P using the positive semidefinite cone: a positive semidefinite lift (psd lift) of a polytope P is a representation of P as the projection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone \$\backslash mathbf\{S\}\^{}d\_+\$. Such a representation allows linear optimization problems over P to be written as semidefinite programs of size d. Such representations can be beneficial in practice when d is much smaller than the number of facets of the polytope P. In this paper we are concerned with so-called equivariant psd lifts (also known as symmetric psd lifts) which respect the symmetries of the polytope P. We present a representation-theoretic framework to study equivariant psd lifts of a certain class of symmetric polytopes known as orbitopes. Our main result is a structure theorem where we show that any equivariant psd lift of size d of an orbitope is of sum-of-squares type where the functions in the sum-of-squares decomposition come from an invariant subspace of dimension smaller than d\^{}3. We use this framework to study two well-known families of polytopes, namely the parity polytope and the cut polytope, and we prove exponential lower bounds for equivariant psd lifts of these polytopes.},

abstract = {We analyze the convergence rate of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing the sum of two or more nonsmooth convex separable functions subject to linear constraints. Previous analysis of the ADMM typically assumes that the objective function is the sum of only two convex functions defined on two separable blocks of variables even though the algorithm works well in numerical experiments for three or more blocks. Moreover, there has been no rate of convergence analysis for the ADMM without strong convexity in the objective function. In this paper we establish the global linear convergence of the ADMM for minimizing the sum of any number of convex separable functions. This result settles a key question regarding the convergence of the ADMM when the number of blocks is more than two or if the strong convexity is absent. It also implies the linear convergence of the ADMM for several contemporary applications including LASSO, Group LASSO and Sparse Group LASSO without any strong convexity assumption. Our proof is based on estimating the distance from a dual feasible solution to the optimal dual solution set by the norm of a certain proximal residual, and by requiring the dual stepsize to be sufficiently small.},

abstract = {Recently, several convergence rate results for Douglas-Rachford splitting and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) have been presented in the literature. In this paper, we show linear convergence rate bounds for Douglas-Rachford splitting under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions. We show that these bounds generalize and/or improve on similar bounds in the literature and that the bounds are tight for the class of problems under consideration. For finite dimensional Euclidean problems, we show how the rate bounds depend on the metric that is used in the algorithm. We also show how to select this metric to optimize the bound. Many real-world problems do not satisfy both the smoothness and strongly convexity assumptions. Therefore, we also propose heuristic metric and parameter selection methods to improve the performance of a wider class of problems. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is confirmed in a numerical example on a model predictive control problem, where improvements of more than one order of magnitude are observed.},

abstract = {We exhibit a strong connection between cover times of graphs, Gaussian processes, and Talagrand's theory of majorizing measures. In particular, we show that the cover time of any graph \$G\$ is equivalent, up to universal constants, to the square of the expected maximum of the Gaussian free field on \$G\$, scaled by the number of edges in \$G\$. This allows us to resolve a number of open questions. We give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that computes the cover time to within an O(1) factor for any graph, answering a question of Aldous and Fill (1994). We also positively resolve the blanket time conjectures of Winkler and Zuckerman (1996), showing that for any graph, the blanket and cover times are within an O(1) factor. The best previous approximation factor for both these problems was \$O((\backslash log \backslash log n)\^{}2)\$ for \$n\$-vertex graphs, due to Kahn, Kim, Lovasz, and Vu (2000).},

abstract = {Functionals of the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM) are routinely minimized under Coleman's ensemble \$N\$-representability conditions. Recently, the topic of pure-state \$N\$-representability conditions, also known as generalized Pauli constraints, received increased attention following the discovery of a systematic way to derive them for any number of electrons and any finite dimensionality of the Hilbert space. The target of this work is to assess the potential impact of the enforcement of the pure-state conditions on the results of reduced density-matrix functional theory calculations. In particular, we examine whether the standard minimization of typical 1-RDM functionals under the ensemble \$N\$-representability conditions violates the pure-state conditions for prototype 3-electron systems. We also enforce the pure-state conditions, in addition to the ensemble ones, for the same systems and functionals and compare the correlation energies and optimal occupation numbers with those obtained by the enforcement of the ensemble conditions alone.},

abstract = {In this paper we show how to accelerate randomized coordinate descent methods and achieve faster convergence rates without paying per-iteration costs in asymptotic running time. In particular, we show how to generalize and efficiently implement a method proposed by Nesterov, giving faster asymptotic running times for various algorithms that use standard coordinate descent as a black box. In addition to providing a proof of convergence for this new general method, we show that it is numerically stable, efficiently implementable, and in certain regimes, asymptotically optimal.   To highlight the computational power of this algorithm, we show how it can used to create faster linear system solvers in several regimes:   - We show how this method achieves a faster asymptotic runtime than conjugate gradient for solving a broad class of symmetric positive definite systems of equations.   - We improve the best known asymptotic convergence guarantees for Kaczmarz methods, a popular technique for image reconstruction and solving overdetermined systems of equations, by accelerating a randomized algorithm of Strohmer and Vershynin.   - We achieve the best known running time for solving Symmetric Diagonally Dominant (SDD) system of equations in the unit-cost RAM model, obtaining an O(m log\^{}\{3/2\} n (log log n)\^{}\{1/2\} log (log n / eps)) asymptotic running time by accelerating a recent solver by Kelner et al.   Beyond the independent interest of these solvers, we believe they highlight the versatility of the approach of this paper and we hope that they will open the door for further algorithmic improvements in the future.},

Here we report the design and synthesis of a novel dimeric inhibitor, Tat-NPEG4(IETDV)(2) (Tat-N-dimer), which binds the tandem PDZ1-2 domain of PSD-95 with an unprecedented high affinity of 4.6 nM, and displays extensive protease-resistance as evaluated in vitro by stability-measurements in human blood plasma. X-ray crystallography, NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) deduced a true bivalent interaction between dimeric inhibitor and PDZ1-2, and also provided a dynamic model of the conformational changes of PDZ1-2 induced by the dimeric inhibitor. A single intravenous injection of Tat-N-dimer (3 nmol/g) to mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia reduces infarct volume with 40\% and restores motor functions. Thus, Tat-N-dimer is a highly efficacious neuroprotective agent with therapeutic potential in stroke.},

We study the difference between these two versions under different conditions on the subsets that the algorithm may query/sample, and in both the case that the algorithm is adaptive and the case where it is non-adaptive. In particular we focus on a natural family of allowed subsets, which correspond to intervals, as well as variants of this family.},

This usually happens in techniques, such as Quantitative Feedback Theory, where the control problem is developed in the frequency domain. Therefore, not only process plants and disturbances should be specified in this domain, but also the limits and restrictions initially imposed in time. The question is important if we consider that any deviation in the parameters transfer from one domain to another will decisively influence in the development of the problem and, above all, in the finally result expressed in temporal terms. The technique presented allows the translation of the upper frequency limit in generic tracking specifications from time domain to frequency domain accurately.

All our results are in the standard word RAM model for points in rank space:   ** We present two data structures for 2-d orthogonal range emptiness. The first achieves O(n lglg n) space and O(lglg n) query time. This improves the previous results by Alstrup, Brodal, and Rauhe(FOCS'00), with O(n lg\^{}eps n) space and O(lglg n) query time, or with O(nlglg n) space and O(lg\^{}2 lg n) query time. Our second data structure uses O(n) space and answers queries in O(lg\^{}eps n) time. The best previous O(n)-space data structure, due to Nekrich (WADS'07), answers queries in O(lg n/lglg n) time.   ** For 3-d orthogonal range reporting, we obtain space O(n lg\^{}\{1+eps\} n) and query time O(lglg n + k), for any constant eps>0. This improves previous results by Afshani (ESA'08), Karpinski and Nekrich (COCOON'09), and Chan (SODA'11), with O(n lg\^{}3 n) space and O(lglg n + k) query time, or with O(n lg\^{}\{1+eps\} n) space and O(lg\^{}2 lg n + k) query time. This implies improved bounds for orthogonal range reporting in all constant dimensions above 3.   ** We give a randomized algorithm for 4-d offline dominance range reporting/emptiness with running time O(n lg n + k).

The best previous result was an O(n lg n lglg n) algorithm due to Gabow, Bentley, and Tarjan (STOC'84). This implies record time bounds for the maxima problem in all constant dimensions above 4.},

abstract = {Decomposition theorems in classical Fourier analysis enable us to express a bounded function in terms of few linear phases with large Fourier coefficients plus a part that is pseudorandom with respect to linear phases. The Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be viewed as an algorithmic analogue of such a decomposition as it gives a way to efficiently find the linear phases associated with large Fourier coefficients.   In the study of "quadratic Fourier analysis", higher-degree analogues of such decompositions have been developed in which the pseudorandomness property is stronger but the structured part correspondingly weaker. For example, it has previously been shown that it is possible to express a bounded function as a sum of a few quadratic phases plus a part that is small in the \$U\^{}3\$ norm, defined by Gowers for the purpose of counting arithmetic progressions of length 4. We give a polynomial time algorithm for computing such a decomposition.   A key part of the algorithm is a local self-correction procedure for Reed-Muller codes of order 2 (over \$\backslash F\_2\^{}n\$) for a function at distance \$1/2-\backslash epsilon\$ from a codeword. Given a function \$f:\backslash F\_2\^{}n \backslash to \backslash\{-1,1\backslash\}\$ at fractional Hamming distance \$1/2-\backslash epsilon\$ from a quadratic phase (which is a codeword of Reed-Muller code of order 2), we give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in \$n\$ and finds a codeword at distance at most \$1/2-\backslash eta\$ for \$\backslash eta = \backslash eta(\backslash epsilon)\$. This is an algorithmic analogue of Samorodnitsky's result, which gave a tester for the above problem. To our knowledge, it represents the first instance of a correction procedure for any class of codes, beyond the list-decoding radius.   In the process, we give algorithmic versions of results from additive combinatorics used in Samorodnitsky's proof and a refined version of the inverse theorem for the Gowers \$U\^{}3\$ norm over \$\backslash F\_2\^{}n\$.},

Specifically, we will describe ``quadratic objects'' of various types and their relation to additive structures, particularly four-term arithmetic progressions.   I will focus on qualitative results, referring the reader to the literature for the many interesting quantitative questions in this theory.

@article{Fawzi2014,
abstract = {Given a polytope P in \$\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}n\$, we say that P has a positive semidefinite lift (psd lift) of size d if one can express P as the linear projection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone \$\backslash mathbf\{S\}\^{}d\_+\$. If a polytope P has symmetry, we can consider equivariant psd lifts, i.e. those psd lifts that respect the symmetry of P. One of the simplest families of polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the plane, which have played an important role in the study of linear programming lifts (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd lifts of regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares hierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly ceil(N/4) iterations and thus yields an equivariant psd lift of size linear in N. In contrast we show that one can construct an equivariant psd lift of the regular 2\^{}n-gon of size 2n-1, which is exponentially smaller than the psd lift of the sum-of-squares hierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares certificate for the facet-defining inequalities of the regular 2\^{}n-gon, i.e., one that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any equivariant LP lift of the regular 2\^{}n-gon must have size 2\^{}n, this gives the first example of a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes of equivariant LP lifts and equivariant psd lifts. Finally we prove that our construction is essentially optimal by showing that any equivariant psd lift of the regular N-gon must have size at least logarithmic in N.},

@article{Delikaraoglou2015,
abstract = {Considering that the existing setup of the European electricity markets promotes the spatial coordination of neighbouring power systems only on the day-ahead market stage, regional system operators have to rely mainly on their internal balancing resources in order to guarantee system security. However, as power systems are forced to operate closer to their technical limits, where flexible generation becomes scarce, the conventional market paradigm may not be able to respond effectively on the wide range of uncertainty. The operational flexibility of the power system depends both on the technical parameters of its components, i.e., generators and transmission infrastructure, as well as on the operational practices that make optimal use of the available assets. This work focuses on alternative market designs that enable sharing of cross-border balancing resources between adjacent power systems through High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnections which provide increased controllability. In this context, we formulate a stochastic market-clearing algorithm that attains full spatio-temporal integration of reserve capacity, day-ahead and balancing markets. Against this benchmark we compare two deterministic market designs with varying degrees of coordination between the reserve capacity and energy services, both followed by a real-time mechanism. Our study reveals the inefficiency of deterministic approaches as the shares of wind power increase. Nevertheless, enforcing a tighter coordination between the reserves and energy trading floors may improve considerably the expected system cost compared to a sequential market design. Aiming to provide some insights for improvement of the sequential market-clearing, we analyse the effect of explicit transmission allocation between energy and reserves for different HVDC capacities and identify the market dynamics that dictate the optimal ratio.},

@article{Carli2014,
abstract = {A new nonparametric approach for system identification has been recently proposed where the impulse response is modeled as the realization of a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) has to be estimated from data. In this scheme, quality of the estimates crucially depends on the parametrization of the covariance of the Gaussian process. A family of kernels that have been shown to be particularly effective in the system identification framework is the family of Diagonal/Correlated (DC) kernels. Maximum entropy properties of a related family of kernels, the Tuned/Correlated (TC) kernels, have been recently pointed out in the literature. In this paper we show that maximum entropy properties indeed extend to the whole family of DC kernels. The maximum entropy interpretation can be exploited in conjunction with results on matrix completion problems in the graphical models literature to shed light on the structure of the DC kernel. In particular, we prove that the DC kernel admits a closed-form factorization, inverse and determinant. These results can be exploited both to improve the numerical stability and to reduce the computational complexity associated with the computation of the DC estimator.},

abstract = {Practical storage systems often adopt erasure codes to tolerate device failures and sector failures, both of which are prevalent in the field. However, traditional erasure codes employ device-level redundancy to protect against sector failures, and hence incur significant space overhead. Recent sector-disk (SD) codes are available only for limited configurations. By making a relaxed but practical assumption, we construct a general family of erasure codes called $\backslash$emph\{STAIR codes\}, which efficiently and provably tolerate both device and sector failures without any restriction on the size of a storage array and the numbers of tolerable device failures and sector failures. We propose the $\backslash$emph\{upstairs encoding\} and $\backslash$emph\{downstairs encoding\} methods, which provide complementary performance advantages for different configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on STAIR codes in terms of space saving, encoding/decoding speed, and update cost. We demonstrate that STAIR codes not only improve space efficiency over traditional erasure codes, but also provide better computational efficiency than SD codes based on our special code construction. Finally, we present analytical models that characterize the reliability of STAIR codes, and show that the support of a wider range of configurations by STAIR codes is critical for tolerating sector failure bursts discovered in the field.},

The \$N\$ components of the latent vector represent sub-channels states, that change dynamically from "busy" to "idle" and vice versa, as a Markov chain that is biased towards producing sparse vectors. To identify the optimal strategy we formulate the Multi-Armed Bandit Compressive Sensing (MAB-CS) problem, generalizing the popular Cognitive Spectrum Sensing model, in which the CR can sense \$K\$ out of the \$N\$ sub-channels, as well as the typical static setting of Compressive Sensing, in which the CR observes \$K\$ linear combinations of the \$N\$ dimensional sparse vector. The CR opportunistic choice of the sensing matrix should balance the desire of revealing the state of as many dimensions of the latent vector as possible, while not exceeding the limits beyond which the vector support is no longer uniquely identifiable.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging approach for the acquisition of signals having a sparse or compressible representation in some basis. While the CS literature has mostly focused on problems involving 1-D signals and 2-D images, many important applications involve multidimensional signals; the construction of sparsifying bases and measurement systems for such signals is complicated by their higher dimensionality. In this paper, we propose the use of Kronecker product matrices in CS for two purposes. First, such matrices can act as sparsifying bases that jointly model the structure present in all of the signal dimensions. Second, such matrices can represent the measurement protocols used in distributed settings. Our formulation enables the derivation of analytical bounds for the sparse approximation of multidimensional signals and CS recovery performance, as well as a means of evaluating novel distributed measurement schemes.},

abstract = {Sampling from various kinds of distributions is an issue of paramount importance in statistics since it is often the key ingredient for constructing estimators, test procedures or confidence intervals. In many situations, the exact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally expensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling strategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful nonasymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in the high-dimensional problems. This paper makes some progress in this direction by considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and log-concave density defined on \$\backslash mathbb R\^{}p\$, for some integer \$p>0\$. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the true distribution by the one obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its variants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with various experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of continuous-time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the framework of distributions with log-concave densities considered in the present work.},

We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence \$(\backslash delta\_m)\_\{m \backslash geq 0\}\$. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type \$\backslash delta\_m \backslash asymp m\^{}\{-1/3\}\$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}(m\^{}\{-1/3\})\$},

These flaws lead to non-uniformity of the resulting pseudo-random numbers and consequently to noticeable deviations of their outputs from the required distributions. In addition, we show that the underlying uniform PRNG of the published implementation of Matlab's $\backslash$texttt\{randn\}, which is also based on the Ziggurat method, is not uniformly distributed with correlations between consecutive pairs. Also, we show that the simple linear initialization of the registers in matlab's $\backslash$texttt\{randn\} may lead to non-trivial correlations between output sequences initialized with different (related or even random unrelated) seeds.

In this paper, we propose a novel "listen-and-talk" (LAT) protocol with the help of the full-duplex (FD) technique that allows SUs to simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum. Analysis of sensing performance and SU's throughput are given for the proposed LAT protocol. And we find that due to self-interference caused by FD, increasing transmitting power of SUs does not always benefit to SU's throughput, which implies the existence of a power-throughput tradeoff. Besides, though the LAT protocol suffers from self-interference, it allows longer transmission time, while the performance of the traditional LBT protocol is limited by channel spatial correction and relatively shorter transmission period. To this end, we also present an adaptive scheme to improve SUs' throughput by switching between the LAT and LBT protocols. Numerical results are provided to verify the proposed methods and the theoretical results.},

abstract = {A denoising algorithm seeks to remove perturbations or errors from a signal. The last three decades have seen extensive research devoted to this arena, and as a result, today's denoisers are highly optimized algorithms that effectively remove large amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a small number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms can be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation. This paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic denoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, in this paper, we develop a denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) algorithm that is capable of high-performance reconstruction. We demonstrate that, for an appropriate choice of denoiser, D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance for natural images. We explain the exceptional performance of D-AMP by analyzing some of its theoretical features. A critical insight in our approach is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in the D-AMP iterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very close to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to remove.},

Integrated, post-correlation data are first passed through a nearly lossless rounding step which compares the precision of the data to a generalized and calibration-independent form of the radiometer equation. This allows the precision of the data to be reduced in a way that has an insignificant impact on the data. The newly developed Bitshuffle lossless compression algorithm is subsequently applied. When the algorithm is used in conjunction with the HDF5 library and data format, data produced by the CHIME Pathfinder telescope is compressed to 28\% of its original size and decompression throughputs in excess of 1 GB/s are obtained on a single core.},

abstract = {This paper introduces several new algorithms for consensus over the special orthogonal group. By relying on a convex relaxation of the space of rotation matrices, consensus over rotation elements is reduced to solving a convex problem with a unique global solution. The consensus protocol is then implemented as a distributed optimization using (i) dual decomposition, and (ii) both semi and fully distributed variants of the alternating direction method of multipliers technique -- all with strong convergence guarantees. The convex relaxation is shown to be exact at all iterations of the dual decomposition based method, and exact once consensus is reached in the case of the alternating direction method of multipliers. Further, analytic and/or efficient solutions are provided for each iteration of these distributed computation schemes, allowing consensus to be reached without any online optimization. Examples in satellite attitude alignment with up to 100 agents, an estimation problem from computer vision, and a rotation averaging problem on \$SO(6)\$ validate the approach.},

abstract = {Why does Deep Learning work? What representations does it capture? How do higher-order representations emerge? We study these questions from the perspective of group theory, thereby opening a new approach towards a theory of Deep learning.   One factor behind the recent resurgence of the subject is a key algorithmic step called pre-training: first search for a good generative model for the input samples, and repeat the process one layer at a time. We show deeper implications of this simple principle, by establishing a connection with the interplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although the neural networks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of \{$\backslash$em shadow\} groups whose elements serve as close approximations.   Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a mechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for features with minimal orbits. Intuitively, these features are in a way the \{$\backslash$em simplest\}. Which explains why a deep learning network learns simple features first. Next, we show how the same principle, when repeated in the deeper layers, can capture higher order representations, and why representation complexity increases as the layers get deeper.},

They give rise to algorithms in which the simple pieces of the decomposition are processed individually. This leads to easily implementable and highly parallelizable algorithms, which often obtain nearly state-of-the-art performance.   In this paper, we provide a comprehensive convergence rate analysis of the Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS), Peaceman-Rachford splitting (PRS), and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms under various regularity assumptions including strong convexity, Lipschitz differentiability, and bounded linear regularity. The main consequence of this work is that relaxed PRS and ADMM automatically adapt to the regularity of the problem and achieve convergence rates that improve upon the (tight) worst-case rates that hold in the absence of such regularity. All of the results are obtained using simple techniques.},

abstract = {The neighbourhood-based Collaborative Filtering is a widely used method in recommender systems. However, the risks of revealing customers' privacy during the process of filtering have attracted noticeable public concern recently. Specifically, \$k\$NN attack discloses the target user's sensitive information by creating \$k\$ fake nearest neighbours by non-sensitive information. Among the current solutions against \$k\$NN attack, the probabilistic methods showed a powerful privacy preserving effect. However, the existing probabilistic methods neither guarantee enough prediction accuracy due to the global randomness, nor provide assured security enforcement against \$k\$NN attack. To overcome the problems of current probabilistic methods, we propose a novel approach, Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required security guarantee while achieving the optimal prediction accuracy against \$k\$NN attack. In this paper, we define the sum of \$k\$ neighbours' similarity as the accuracy metric \$\backslash alpha\$, the number of user partitions, across which we select the \$k\$ neighbours, as the security metric \$\backslash beta\$. Differing from the present methods that globally selected neighbours, our method selects neighbours from each group with exponential differential privacy to decrease the magnitude of noise. Theoretical and experimental analysis show that to achieve the same security guarantee against \$k\$NN attack, our approach ensures the optimal prediction accuracy.},

In this theory, the sensing mechanism simply selects sensing vectors independently at random from a probability distribution F; it includes all models - e.g. Gaussian, frequency measurements - discussed in the literature, but also provides a framework for new measurement strategies as well. We prove that if the probability distribution F obeys a simple incoherence property and an isotropy property, one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number of noisy measurements. The novelty is that our recovery results do not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) - they make use of a much weaker notion - or a random model for the signal. As an example, the paper shows that a signal with s nonzero entries can be faithfully recovered from about s log n Fourier coefficients that are contaminated with noise.},

In some cases the embedding space is trained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic embedding space is established by an independent natural language processing task, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second stage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their advantages over the traditional $\backslash$nway\{\} classification framing of image understanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning -- the ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object categories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image embedding system from any existing $\backslash$nway\{\} image classifier and a semantic word embedding model, which contains the \$\backslash n\$ class labels in its vocabulary. Our method maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of the class label embedding vectors, and requires no additional training. We show that this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated with more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the art methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task.},

We discuss prospects for future indirect (in particular the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA) and direct detection experiments.

It is based on a Variational Bayesian formulation that aims at approximating the exact posterior by means of solving an optimization problem over an appropriately selected family of distributions. The goal is two-fold. Firstly, to find lower-dimensional representations of the unknown parameter vector that capture as much as possible of the associated posterior density, and secondly to enable the computation of the approximate posterior density with as few forward calls as possible. We discuss how these objectives can be achieved by using a fully Bayesian argumentation and employing the marginal likelihood or evidence as the ultimate model validation metric for any proposed dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology for problems in nonlinear elastography where the identification of the mechanical properties of biological materials can inform non-invasive, medical diagnosis. An Importance Sampling scheme is finally employed in order to validate the results and assess the efficacy of the approximations provided.},

abstract = {The quantum Szilard engine (QSZE) is a conceptual quantum engine for understanding the fundamental physics of quantum thermodynamics and information physics. We generalize the QSZE to an arbitrary spin case, i.e., a spin QSZE (SQSZE), and we systematically study the basic physical properties of both fermion and boson SQSZEs in a low-temperature approximation. We give the analytic formulation of the total work. For the fermion SQSZE, the work might be absorbed from the environment, and the change rate of the work with temperature exhibits periodicity and even-odd oscillation, which is a generalization of a spinless QSZE. It is interesting that the average absorbed work oscillates regularly and periodically in a large-number limit, which implies that the average absorbed work in a fermion SQSZE is neither an intensive quantity nor an extensive quantity. The phase diagrams of both fermion and boson SQSZEs give the SQSZE doing positive or negative work in the parameter space of the temperature and the particle number of the system, but they have different behaviors because the spin degrees of the fermion and the boson play different roles in their configuration states and corresponding statistical properties. The critical temperature of phase transition depends sensitively on the particle number. By using Landauer's erasure principle, we give the erasure work in a thermodynamic cycle, and we define an efficiency (we refer to it as information-work efficiency) to measure the engine's ability of utilizing information to extract work. We also give the conditions under which the maximum extracted work and highest information-work efficiencies for fermion and boson SQSZEs can be achieved.},

Our calculations show that, if the lines are optically thin, the populations of the hyperfine states, F, within a given rotational manifold are proportional to their statistical weights, (2F + 1) -- i.e. in local thermodynamic equilibrium -- over the entire range of densities. We have re-analysed IRAM 30 m telescope observations of 13CN hyperfine transitions (N = 1 \$\backslash rightarrow\$ 0) in four starless cores. A comparison of these observations with our calculations confirms that the hyperfine states are statistically populated in these sources.},

For this error metric, we prove that, in an asymptotic setting where the signal dimension \$N\backslash to\backslash infty\$, the \$\backslash ell\_\backslash infty\$-norm error always comes from the Gaussian component that has the largest variance, and the Wiener filter asymptotically achieves the optimal expected \$\backslash ell\_\backslash infty\$-norm error. The i.i.d. Gaussian mixture case is easily applicable to i.i.d. Bernoulli-Gaussian distributions, which are often used to model sparse signals. Finally, our results can be extended to linear mixing systems with i.i.d. Gaussian mixture inputs, in settings where a linear mixing system can be decoupled to parallel Gaussian channels.},

In this paper, we show linear convergence rate bounds for Douglas-Rachford splitting under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions. We show that these bounds generalize and/or improve on similar bounds in the literature and that the bounds are tight for the class of problems under consideration. For finite dimensional Euclidean problems, we show how the rate bounds depend on the metric that is used in the algorithm. We also show how to select this metric to optimize the bound. Many real-world problems do not satisfy both the smoothness and strongly convexity assumptions. Therefore, we also propose heuristic metric and parameter selection methods to improve the performance of a wider class of problems. The efficiency of the proposed heuristics is confirmed in a numerical example on a model predictive control problem, where improvements of more than one order of magnitude are observed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of collaboratively estimating the sparsity pattern of a sparse signal with multiple measurement data in distributed networks. We assume that each node makes Compressive Sensing (CS) based measurements via random projections regarding the same sparse signal. We propose a distributed greedy algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in which the sparse support is estimated iteratively while fusing indices estimated at distributed nodes. In the proposed distributed framework, each node has to perform less number of iterations of OMP compared to the sparsity index of the sparse signal. Thus, with each node having a very small number of compressive measurements, a significant performance gain in support recovery is achieved via the proposed collaborative scheme compared to the case where each node estimates the sparsity pattern independently and then fusion is performed to get a global estimate. We further extend the algorithm to estimate the sparsity pattern in a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the algorithm first detects the presence of a sparse signal collaborating among nodes with a fewer number of iterations of OMP and then increases the number of iterations to estimate the sparsity pattern only if the signal is detected.},

Examples in the classes of DM-MMNs include wireless erasure networks, DM-MMNs consisting of independent discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) as well as single-destination DM-MMNs consisting of independent DMCs with destination feedback.

The flow causes particles to layer into rotating concentric rings linked to the local, position-dependent shear rate, which triggers two distinct dynamical regimes: particles move continuously "Flowing") close to the microdisk, or exhibit intermittent "Hopping" between local energy minima farther away. The shear-rate dependent surface viscosity of a monolayer can be extracted from an interfacial stress balance, giving "macroscopic" flow curves whose behavior corresponds to the distinct microscopic regimes of particle motion. Hopping Regions correspond to a surface yield stress \$\backslash eta \backslash sim \backslash tau\_S\^{}Y \backslash dot\{\backslash gamma\}\^{}\{-1\}\$, whereas Flowing Regions exhibit surface viscosities with power-law shear-thinning characteristics.},

Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost is prohibitive whenever the histograms' dimension exceeds a few hundreds. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem.},

To this end, we propose using an automated sequential stopping procedure that terminates the simulation when the computational uncertainty is small relative to the posterior uncertainty. Such a stopping rule has previously been shown to work well in settings with posteriors of moderate dimension. In this paper, we illustrate its utility in high-dimensional simulations while overcoming some current computational issues. Further, we investigate the relationship between the stopping rule and effective sample size. As examples, we consider two complex Bayesian analyses on spatially and temporally correlated datasets. The first involves a dynamic space-time model on weather station data and the second a spatial variable selection model on fMRI brain imaging data. Our results show the sequential stopping rule is easy to implement, provides uncertainty estimates, and performs well in high-dimensional settings.},

abstract = {The estimation of a random vector with independent components passed through a linear transform followed by a componentwise (possibly nonlinear) output map arises in a range of applications. Approximate message passing (AMP) methods, based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation, have recently attracted considerable attention for such problems. For large random transforms, these methods exhibit fast convergence and admit precise analytic characterizations with testable conditions for optimality, even for certain non-convex problem instances. However, the behavior of AMP under general transforms is not fully understood. In this paper, we consider the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm and relate the method to more common optimization techniques. This analysis enables a precise characterization of the GAMP algorithm fixed-points that applies to arbitrary transforms. In particular, we show that the fixed points of the so-called max-sum GAMP algorithm for MAP estimation are critical points of a constrained maximization of the posterior density. The fixed-points of the sum-product GAMP algorithm for estimation of the posterior marginals can be interpreted as critical points of a certain free energy.},

abstract = {A multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method is proposed and analyzed for solving the Klein-Gordon-Schr$\backslash$"\{o\}dinger (KGS) equations in the nonrelativistic limit regime with a dimensionless parameter \$0<\backslash varepsilon\backslash le1\$ which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In fact, the solution to the KGS equations propagates waves with wavelength at \$O(\backslash varepsilon\^{}2)\$ and \$O(1)\$ in time and space, respectively, when \$0<\backslash varepsilon\backslash ll 1\$, which brings significantly numerical burdens in practical computation. The MTI-FP method is designed by adapting a multiscale decomposition by frequency to the solution at each time step and applying the Fourier pseudospectral discretization and exponential wave integrators for spatial and temporal derivatives, respectively. We rigorously establish two independent error bounds for the MTI-FP at \$O(\backslash tau\^{}2/\backslash varepsilon\^{}2+h\^{}\{m\_0\})\$ and \$O(\backslash varepsilon\^{}2+h\^{}\{m\_0\})\$ for \$\backslash varepsilon\backslash in(0,1]\$ with \$\backslash tau\$ time step size, \$h\$ mesh size and \$m\_0\backslash ge 4\$ an integer depending on the regularity of the solution, which imply that the MTI-FP converges uniformly and optimally in space with exponential convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and uniformly in time with linear convergence rate at \$O(\backslash tau)\$ for \$\backslash varepsilon\backslash in(0,1]\$ and optimally with quadratic convergence rate at \$O(\backslash tau\^{}2)\$ in the regime when either \$\backslash varepsilon=O(1)\$ or \$0<\backslash varepsilon\backslash le \backslash tau\$. Thus the meshing strategy requirement (or \$\backslash varepsilon\$-scalability) of the MTI-FP is \$\backslash tau=O(1)\$ and \$h=O(1)\$ for \$0<\backslash varepsilon\backslash ll 1\$, which is significantly better than classical methods. Numerical results demonstrate that our error bounds are optimal and sharp. Finally, the MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the KGS equations to the limiting models in the nonrelativistic limit regime.},

This paper tackles the problem of constructing a CS-based symmetric cipher under the key reuse circumstance, i.e., the cipher is resistant to common attacks even a fixed measurement matrix is used multiple times. To this end, we suggest a bi-level protected CS (BLP-CS) model which makes use of the advantage of the non-RIP measurement matrix construction. Specifically, two kinds of artificial basis mismatch techniques are investigated to construct key-related sparsifying bases. It is demonstrated that the encoding process of BLP-CS is simply a random linear projection, which is the same as the basic CS model. However, decoding the linear measurements requires knowledge of both the key-dependent sensing matrix and its sparsifying basis. The proposed model is exemplified by sampling images as a joint data acquisition and protection layer for resource-limited wireless sensors. Simulation results and numerical analyses have justified that the new model can be applied in circumstances where the measurement matrix can be re-used.},

abstract = {We discuss coding techniques that allow reliable transmission up to the capacity of a discrete memoryless \{$\backslash$em a\}symmetric channel. To do so, we take the point of view of modern coding theory and we discuss how recent advances in coding for symmetric channels help in providing more efficient solutions also for the asymmetric case. In more detail, we consider three basic approaches.   The first one is Gallager's scheme that consists of concatenating a linear code with a non-linear mapper so that the input distribution can be appropriately shaped. We explicitly show that both polar codes and spatially coupled codes can be employed in this scenario. Furthermore, we derive a scaling law between the gap to capacity, the cardinality of the input and output alphabets of the channel, and the required size of the mapper.   The second one is an integrated approach in which the coding scheme is used both for source coding, in order to create codewords distributed according to the capacity-achieving input distribution, \{$\backslash$em and\} for channel coding, in order to provide error protection. Such a technique has been recently introduced by Honda and Yamamoto in the context of polar codes, and we show how to apply it also to the design of sparse graph codes.   The third approach is based on an idea due to B$\backslash$"ocherer and Mathar and separates completely the two tasks of source coding and channel coding by "chaining" together several codewords. We prove that we can combine \{$\backslash$em any\} suitable source code with \{$\backslash$em any\} suitable channel code in order to provide optimal schemes for asymmetric channels. In particular, we show that again both polar codes and spatially coupled codes fulfill the required conditions.},

@article{Barman2012,
abstract = {When binary linear error-correcting codes are used over symmetric channels, a relaxed version of the maximum likelihood decoding problem can be stated as a linear program (LP). This LP decoder can be used to decode error-correcting codes at bit-error-rates comparable to state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders, but with significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP decoding when implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the block lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper we draw on decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient distributed algorithms for LP decoding.   The key enabling technical result is a "two-slice" characterization of the geometry of the parity polytope, which is the convex hull of all codewords of a single parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the representation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we develop an efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the parity polytope. This projection is required by ADMM and allows us to use LP decoding, with all its theoretical guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes efficiently.   We present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The waterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not observed for LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of LP decoding using ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP decoder, is fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of message-passing with a particularly simple schedule.},

abstract = {In the community of Linked Data, anyone can publish their data as Linked Data on the web because of the openness of the Semantic Web. As such, RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples described the same real-world entity can be obtained from multiple sources; it inevitably results in conflicting objects for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. The objective of this study is to identify one truth from multiple conflicting objects for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. An intuitive principle based on common sense is that an object from a reliable source is trustworthy; thus, a source that provide trustworthy object is reliable. Many truth discovery methods based on this principle have been proposed to estimate source reliability and identify the truth. However, the effectiveness of existing truth discovery methods is significantly affected by the number of objects provided by each source. Therefore, these methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conflicts in Linked Data with a scale-free property, i.e., most of the sources provide few conflicting objects, whereas only a few sources have many conflicting objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called TruthDiscover to identify the truth in Linked Data with a scale-free property. Two strategies are adopted in TruthDiscover to reduce the effect of the scale-free property on truth discovery. First, this approach leverages the topological properties of the Source Belief Graph to estimate the priori beliefs of sources, which are utilized to smooth the trustworthiness of sources. Second, this approach utilizes the Hidden Markov Random Field to model the interdependencies between objects to estimate the trust values of objects accurately. Experiments are conducted in the six datasets to evaluate TruthDiscover.},

Another structure forms a free-memory method used as supervised learning tool. The setting procedure for initializing the recurrent structure of the ESN model can impact on the model performance. On the other hand, the PSO has been shown to be a successful technique for finding optimal points in complex spaces. Here, we present an approach to use the PSO for finding some initial hidden-hidden weights of the ESN model.

These two fundamental features have thus far been distinct concepts. Here we show that they are inextricably and quantitatively linked. Quantum mechanics cannot be more non-local with measurements that respect the uncertainty principle. In fact, the link between uncertainty and non-locality holds for all physical theories.More specifically, the degree of non-locality of any theory is determined by two factors -- the strength of the uncertainty principle, and the strength of a property called ``steering'', which determines which states can be prepared at one location given a measurement at another.},

@article{Fry2015,
abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to consistently compare the assembly of dwarf galaxies in both \$\backslash Lambda\$ dominated, Cold (CDM) and Self--Interacting (SIDM) dark matter models. The SIDM model adopts a constant cross section of 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$, a relatively large value to maximize its effects. These are the first SIDM simulations that are combined with a description of stellar feedback that naturally drives potential fluctuations able to create dark matter cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower the central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 Km/s. This is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos have relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time scales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback. At a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and SIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc. At larger halo masses (\$\backslash sim\$ 10\$\^{}\{10\}\$ solar masses), the introduction of baryonic processes creates field dwarf galaxies with dark matter cores and central DM\$+\$baryon distributions that are effectively indistinguishable between CDM and SIDM. Both models are in broad agreement with observed Local Group field galaxies across the range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate SIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross section that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$ for halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced.},

This is their only role since, as we show, the power function of the Bayes factor test coincides exactly with that of the classical test, once the type I error has been fixed.   For more complex tests involving nuisance parameters, we recover the classical test by using Jeffreys prior on the nuisance parameters, while the prior on the hypothesized parameters can be arbitrary up to a large class.

abstract = {The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) nonoverlapping groups of features. The nonoverlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. Our methods and theoretical results are then generalized to tackle the general overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the l(q) norm. We further extend our algorithm to solve a nonconvex overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the capped norm regularization, which reduces the estimation bias introduced by the convex penalty. We have performed empirical evaluations using both a synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression dataset, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the nonconvex formulation for overlapping group Lasso.},

States are represented by density matrices \$\backslash rho\$ on a Hilbert space and the information-entropy \$-tr(\backslash rho\backslash log\backslash rho)\$ is minimised on pure states (pure states are the vertices of the boundary of the convex set of states). The space of decoherence functions in the consistent histories approach to generalised quantum theory is also a convex set. However, by showing that every decoherence function can be written as a convex combination of two other decoherence functions we demonstrate that there are no `pure' decoherence functions.   The main content of the paper is a new notion of information-entropy in generalised quantum mechanics which is applicable in contexts in which there is no a priori notion of time. Information-entropy is defined first on consistent sets and then we show that it decreases upon refinement of the consistent set. This information-entropy suggests an intrinsic way of giving a consistent set selection criterion.},

abstract = {The relevance of the quasi-two-dimensional spin-1/2 frustrated quantum antiferromagnet due to its possibility of modelling the high-temperature superconducting parent compounds has resulted in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. This paper presents a detailed research of the influence of the varying exchange interactions on the model magnetic properties within the framework of self-consistent spin-wave theory based on Dyson-Maleev representation. Beside the nearest neighbour interaction within the plane, the planar frustration up to the third nearest neighbours, cyclic interaction and the interlayer coupling are taken into account. The detailed description of the elementary spin excitations, staggered magnetization, spin-wave velocity renormalization factor and ground-state energy is given. The results are compared to the predictions of the linear spin-wave theory and when possible also to the second-order perturbative spin-wave expansion results. Finally, having at our disposal improved experimental results for the in-plane spin-wave dispersion in high-\$T\_c\$ copper oxide \$\backslash mbox\{La\}\_2\backslash mbox\{CuO\}\_4\$, the self-consistent spin-wave theory is applied to that compound in order to correct earlier obtained set of exchange parameters and high temperature spin-wave dispersion.},

abstract = {Modern computational statistics is turning more and more to high-dimensional optimization to handle the deluge of big data. Once a model is formulated, its parameters can be estimated by optimization. Because model parsimony is important, models routinely include nondifferentiable penalty terms such as the lasso. This sober reality complicates minimization and maximization. Our broad survey stresses a few important principles in algorithm design. Rather than view these principles in isolation, it is more productive to mix and match them. A few well chosen examples illustrate this point. Algorithm derivation is also emphasized, and theory is downplayed, particularly the abstractions of the convex calculus. Thus, our survey should be useful and accessible to a broad audience.},

abstract = {Sum Product Networks (SPNs) are a recently developed class of deep generative models which compute their associated unnormalized density functions using a special type of arithmetic circuit. When certain sufficient conditions, called the decomposability and completeness conditions (or "D\&C" conditions), are imposed on the structure of these circuits, marginal densities and other useful quantities, which are typically intractable for other deep generative models, can be computed by what amounts to a single evaluation of the network (which is a property known as "validity"). However, the effect that the D\&C conditions have on the capabilities of D\&C SPNs is not well understood.   In this work we analyze the D\&C conditions, expose the various connections that D\&C SPNs have with multilinear arithmetic circuits, and consider the question of how well they can capture various distributions as a function of their size and depth. Among our various contributions is a result which establishes the existence of a relatively simple distribution with fully tractable marginal densities which cannot be efficiently captured by D\&C SPNs of any depth, but which can be efficiently captured by various other deep generative models. We also show that with each additional layer of depth permitted, the set of distributions which can be efficiently captured by D\&C SPNs grows in size. This kind of "depth hierarchy" property has been widely conjectured to hold for various deep models, but has never been proven for any of them. Some of our other contributions include a new characterization of the D\&C conditions as sufficient and necessary ones for a slightly strengthened notion of validity, and various state-machine characterizations of the types of computations that can be performed efficiently by D\&C SPNs.},

Central to our analysis is a problem-specific value \$r\$ which quantifies the communication/computation tradeoff. We show that organizing the communication among nodes as a \$k\$-regular expander graph (Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson, 2002) yields speedups, while when all pairs of nodes communicate (as in a complete graph), there is an optimal number of processors that depends on \$r\$. Surprisingly, a speedup can be obtained, in terms of the time to reach a fixed level of accuracy, by communicating less and less frequently as the computation progresses. Experiments on a real cluster solving metric learning and non-smooth convex minimization tasks demonstrate strong agreement between theory and practice.},

abstract = {In this paper, an efficient distributed approach for implementing the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, named distributed AMP (DAMP), is developed for compressed sensing (CS) recovery in sensor networks with the sparsity K unknown. In the proposed DAMP, distributed sensors do not have to use or know the entire global sensing matrix, and the burden of computation and storage for each sensor is reduced. To reduce communications among the sensors, a new data query algorithm, called global computation for AMP (GCAMP), is proposed. The proposed GCAMP based DAMP approach has exactly the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP algorithm, which is proved theoretically in the paper. The performance of the DAMP approach is evaluated in terms of the communication cost saved by using GCAMP. For comparison purpose, thresholding algorithm (TA), a well known distributed Top-K algorithm, is modified so that it also leads to the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP. Numerical results demonstrate that the GCAMP based DAMP outperforms the Modified TA based DAMP, and reduces the communication cost significantly.},

Although the regularizer and constraint are usually convex, several particular features of these problems (huge dimensionality, non-smoothness) preclude the use of off-the-shelf optimization tools and have stimulated a considerable amount of research. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to handle one class of constrained problems (often known as basis pursuit denoising) tailored to image recovery applications. The proposed algorithm, which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian methods, can be used to deal with a variety of imaging IPLIP, including deconvolution and reconstruction from compressive observations (such as MRI), using either total-variation or wavelet-based (or, more generally, frame-based) regularization. The proposed algorithm is an instance of the so-called "alternating direction method of multipliers", for which convergence sufficient conditions are known; we show that these conditions are satisfied by the proposed algorithm. Experiments on a set of image restoration and reconstruction benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is a strong contender for the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {In this paper we treat both forms of probabilistic inference, estimating marginal probabilities of the joint distribution and finding the most probable assignment, through a unified message-passing algorithm architecture. We generalize the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithms of sum-product and max-product and tree-rewaighted (TRW) sum and max product algorithms (TRBP) and introduce a new set of convergent algorithms based on "convex-free-energy" and Linear-Programming (LP) relaxation as a zero-temprature of a convex-free-energy. The main idea of this work arises from taking a general perspective on the existing BP and TRBP algorithms while observing that they all are reductions from the basic optimization formula of \$f + \backslash sum\_i h\_i\$ where the function \$f\$ is an extended-valued, strictly convex but non-smooth and the functions \$h\_i\$ are extended-valued functions (not necessarily convex). We use tools from convex duality to present the "primal-dual ascent" algorithm which is an extension of the Bregman successive projection scheme and is designed to handle optimization of the general type \$f + \backslash sum\_i h\_i\$. Mapping the fractional-free-energy variational principle to this framework introduces the "norm-product" message-passing. Special cases include sum-product and max-product (BP algorithms) and the TRBP algorithms. When the fractional-free-energy is set to be convex (convex-free-energy) the norm-product is globally convergent for estimating of marginal probabilities and for approximating the LP-relaxation. We also introduce another branch of the norm-product, the "convex-max-product". The convex-max-product is convergent (unlike max-product) and aims at solving the LP-relaxation.},

In particular, the well known kernel density estimator and the kernel mean embedding both have the form of a kernel mean. Unfortunately, kernel means are faced with scalability issues. A single point evaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation time linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present a method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We do so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation error, and then noticing that, for the case of radial kernels, the bound can be minimized by solving the \$k\$-center problem. The outcome is a linear time construction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an automatic sparsity selection scheme. We show the computational gains of our method by looking at three problems involving kernel means: Euclidean embedding of distributions, class proportion estimation, and clustering using the mean-shift algorithm.},

abstract = {Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.},

Our queries ask crowd members to articulate a feature common to two out of three displayed examples. In addition we also ask the crowd to provide binary labels to the remaining examples based on the discovered features. The triples are chosen adaptively based on the labels of the previously discovered features on the data set. In two natural models of features, hierarchical and independent, we show that a simple adaptive algorithm, using "two-out-of-three" similarity queries, recovers all features with less labor than any nonadaptive algorithm.

The first is an Occam bound which handles rules with finite precision parameters and which states that generalization loss is near training loss when the number of bits needed to write the rule is small compared to the sample size. The second is a PAC-Bayesian bound providing a generalization guarantee for posterior distributions rather than for individual rules. The PAC-Bayesian bound naturally handles infinite precision rule parameters, \$L\_2\$ regularization, \{$\backslash$em provides a bound for dropout training\}, and defines a natural notion of a single distinguished PAC-Bayesian posterior distribution. The third bound is a training-variance bound --- a kind of bias-variance analysis but with bias replaced by expected training loss. The training-variance bound dominates the other bounds but is more difficult to interpret. It seems to suggest variance reduction methods such as bagging and may ultimately provide a more meaningful analysis of dropouts.},

This paper, which is presented in two parts, solves this problem by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a binary operation to be polarizing. This (first) part of the paper introduces the mathematical framework that we will use in the second part to characterize the polarizing operations. We define uniformity preserving, irreducible, ergodic and strongly ergodic operations and we study their properties. The concepts of a stable partition and the residue of a stable partition are introduced. We show that an ergodic operation is strongly ergodic if and only if all its stable partitions are their own residues. We also study the products of binary operations and the structure of their stable partitions. We show that the product of a sequence of binary operations is strongly ergodic if and only if all the operations in the sequence are strongly ergodic. In the second part of the paper, we provide a foundation of polarization theory based on the ergodic theory of binary operations that we develop in this part.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating multiple related but distinct graphical models on the basis of a high-dimensional data set with observations that belong to distinct classes. A motivating example occurs in the analysis of gene expression data for tissue samples with and without cancer. In this case, we might wish to estimate a gene expression network for the normal tissue and a gene expression network for the tumor tissue. We expect the two gene expression networks to be similar but not identical to each other, and so more accurate estimation of these two networks may be possible using a joint approach. We propose the joint graphical lasso for this purpose. Rather than estimating a graphical model for each class separately, or a single graphical model across all classes, we borrow strength across the classes in order to estimate multiple graphical models that share certain characteristics, such as the locations or weights of nonzero edges. Our approach is based upon maximizing a penalized log likelihood. We employ fused lasso or group lasso penalties, and implement a very fast computational approach that solves the joint graphical lasso problem. In a simulation study we demonstrate that our proposed approach leads to more accurate estimation of networks and covariance structure than competing approaches. We further illustrate our proposal on a publicly-available lung cancer gene expression data set.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of voltage stability and reactive power balancing in islanded small-scale electrical networks outfitted with DC/AC inverters ("microgrids"). A droop-like voltage feedback controller is proposed which is quadratic in the local voltage magnitude, allowing for the application of circuit-theoretic analysis techniques to the closed-loop system. The operating points of the closed-loop microgrid are in exact correspondence with the solutions of a reduced power flow equation, and we provide explicit solutions and small-signal stability analyses under several static and dynamic load models. Controller optimality is characterized as follows: we show a one-to-one correspondence between the high-voltage equilibrium of the microgrid under quadratic droop control, and the solution of an optimization problem which minimizes a trade-off between reactive power dissipation and voltage deviations. Power sharing performance of the controller is characterized as a function of the controller gains, network topology, and parameters. Perhaps surprisingly, proportional sharing of the total load between inverters is achieved in the low-gain limit, independent of the circuit topology or reactances. All results hold for arbitrary grid topologies, with arbitrary numbers of inverters and loads. Numerical results confirm the robustness of the controller to unmodeled dynamics.},

abstract = {Kernel means are frequently used to represent probability distributions in machine learning problems. In particular, the well known kernel density estimator and the kernel mean embedding both have the form of a kernel mean. Unfortunately, kernel means are faced with scalability issues. A single point evaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation time linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present a method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We do so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation error, and then noticing that, for the case of radial kernels, the bound can be minimized by solving the \$k\$-center problem. The outcome is a linear time construction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an automatic sparsity selection scheme. We show the computational gains of our method by looking at three problems involving kernel means: Euclidean embedding of distributions, class proportion estimation, and clustering using the mean-shift algorithm.},

@article{Fyhn2013d,
abstract = {With the advent of ubiquitous computing there are two design parameters of wireless communication devices that become very important power: efficiency and production cost. Compressive sensing enables the receiver in such devices to sample below the Shannon-Nyquist sampling rate, which may lead to a decrease in the two design parameters. This paper investigates the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) in a general Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) receiver. We show that when using spread spectrum codes in the signal domain, the CS measurement matrix may be simplified. This measurement scheme, named Compressive Spread Spectrum (CSS), allows for a simple, effective receiver design. Furthermore, we numerically evaluate the proposed receiver in terms of bit error rate under different signal to noise ratio conditions and compare it with other receiver structures. These numerical experiments show that though the bit error rate performance is degraded by the subsampling in the CS-enabled receivers, this may be remedied by including quantization in the receiver model. We also study the computational complexity of the proposed receiver design under different sparsity and measurement ratios. Our work shows that it is possible to subsample a CDMA signal using CSS and that in one example the CSS receiver outperforms the classical receiver.},

abstract = {Let A be a d x n matrix and T = T(n-1) be the standard simplex in Rn. Suppose that d and n are both large and comparable: d approximately deltan, delta in (0, 1). We count the faces of the projected simplex AT when the projector A is chosen uniformly at random from the Grassmann manifold of d-dimensional orthoprojectors of Rn. We derive rhoN(delta) > 0 with the property that, for any rho < rhoN(delta), with overwhelming probability for large d, the number of k-dimensional faces of P = AT is exactly the same as for T, for 0 < or = k < or = rhod. This implies that P is left floor rhod right floor-neighborly, and its skeleton Skel(left floor rhod right floor)(P) is combinatorially equivalent to Skel( left floor rhod right floor)(T). We also study a weaker notion of neighborliness where the numbers of k-dimensional faces f(k)(P) > or = f(k)(T)(1-epsilon). Vershik and Sporyshev previously showed existence of a threshold rhoVS(delta) > 0 at which phase transition occurs in k/d. We compute and display rhoVS and compare with rhoN. Corollaries are as follows. (1) The convex hull of n Gaussian samples in Rd, with n large and proportional to d, has the same k-skeleton as the (n-1) simplex, for k < rhoN (d/n)d(1 + oP(1)). (2) There is a "phase transition" in the ability of linear programming to find the sparsest nonnegative solution to systems of underdetermined linear equations. For most systems having a solution with fewer than rhoVS(d/n)d(1 + o(1)) nonzeros, linear programming will find that solution.},

Our goal is to provide a reconstruction of sources within an allowed distortion level at each receiver. We perform joint source-channel coding at each source by randomly projecting source values to a lower dimensional space. We consider sources that satisfy the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition as well as more general sources for which the randomness of the network allows a mapping to lower dimensional spaces. Our approach relies on using analog random linear network coding. The receiver uses compressive sensing decoders to reconstruct sources. Our key insight is the fact that, compressive sensing and analog network coding both preserve the source characteristics required for compressive sensing decoding.},

We consider the recovery of the signal \$x\_o \backslash in \backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}N\$ from \$n\$ random and noisy linear observations \$y= Ax\_o + w\$, where \$A\$ is the measurement matrix and \$w\$ is the noise. The LASSO estimate is given by the solution to the optimization problem \$x\_o\$ with \$\backslash hat\{x\}\_\{\backslash lambda\} = \backslash arg \backslash min\_x \backslash frac\{1\}\{2\} \backslash|y-Ax\backslash|\_2\^{}2 + \backslash lambda \backslash|x\backslash|\_1\$. Despite major progress in the theoretical analysis of the LASSO solution, little is known about its behavior as a function of the regularization parameter \$\backslash lambda\$. In this paper we study two questions in the asymptotic setting (i.e., where \$N \backslash rightarrow \backslash infty\$, \$n \backslash rightarrow \backslash infty\$ while the ratio \$n/N\$ converges to a fixed number in \$(0,1)\$): (i) How does the size of the active set \$\backslash|\backslash hat\{x\}\_\backslash lambda\backslash|\_0/N\$ behave as a function of \$\backslash lambda\$, and (ii) How does the mean square error \$\backslash|\backslash hat\{x\}\_\{\backslash lambda\} - x\_o\backslash|\_2\^{}2/N\$ behave as a function of \$\backslash lambda\$? We then employ these results in a new, reliable algorithm for solving LASSO based on approximate message passing (AMP).},

abstract = {Several problems such as network intrusion, community detection, and disease outbreak can be described by observations attributed to nodes or edges of a graph. In these applications presence of intrusion, community or disease outbreak is characterized by novel observations on some unknown connected subgraph. These problems can be formulated in terms of optimization of suitable objectives on connected subgraphs, a problem which is generally computationally difficult. We overcome the combinatorics of connectivity by embedding connected subgraphs into linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Computationally efficient tests are then realized by optimizing convex objective functions subject to these LMI constraints. We prove, by means of a novel Euclidean embedding argument, that our tests are minimax optimal for exponential family of distributions on 1-D and 2-D lattices. We show that internal conductance of the connected subgraph family plays a fundamental role in characterizing detectability.},

The presence of any inhibitor in a test can prevent the expression of a defective. For this model, we propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design with a low complexity decoding algorithm. We show that the sample complexity of the number of tests required for guaranteed recovery with vanishing error probability using the proposed algorithm scales as \$T=O(d \backslash log n)\$ and \$T=O(\backslash frac\{r\^{}2\}\{d\}\backslash log n)\$ in the regimes \$r=O(d)\$ and \$d=o(r)\$ respectively.

abstract = {By large-distance asymptotics, in conventional scattering theory, at the cost of losing the information of the distance between target and observer, one arrives at an explicit expression for scattering wave functions represented by a scattering phase shift. In the present paper, together with a preceding paper (T. Liu,W.-D. Li, and W.-S. Dai, JHEP06(2014)087), we establish a rigorous scattering theory without imposing large-distance asymptotics. We show that even without large-distance asymptotics, one can also obtain an explicit scattering wave function represented also by a scattering phase shift, in which, of course, the information of the distance is preserved. Nevertheless, the scattering amplitude obtained in the preceding paper depends not only on the scattering angle but also on the distance between target and observer. In this paper, by constructing a scattering boundary condition without large-distance asymptotics, we introduce a scattering amplitude, like that in conventional scattering theory, depending only on the scattering angle and being independent of the distance. Such a scattering amplitude, when taking large-distance asymptotics, will recover the scattering amplitude in conventional scattering theory. The present paper, with the preceding paper, provides a complete scattering theory without large-distance asymptotics.},

abstract = {We formulate and analyze a stochastic threshold group testing problem motivated by biological applications. Here a set of \$n\$ items contains a subset of \$d \backslash ll n\$ defective items. Subsets (pools) of the \$n\$ items are tested -- the test outcomes are negative, positive, or stochastic (negative or positive with certain probabilities that might depend on the number of defectives being tested in the pool), depending on whether the number of defective items in the pool being tested are fewer than the \{$\backslash$it lower threshold\} \$l\$, greater than the \{$\backslash$it upper threshold\} \$u\$, or in between. The goal of a \{$\backslash$it stochastic threshold group testing\} scheme is to identify the set of \$d\$ defective items via a "small" number of such tests. In the regime that \$l = o(d)\$ we present schemes that are computationally feasible to design and implement, and require near-optimal number of tests (significantly improving on existing schemes). Our schemes are robust to a variety of models for probabilistic threshold group testing.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call "fooling images" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

abstract = {An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are discovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light curves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability mechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up to Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether PISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light curve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of macroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting observational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN evolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova evolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The greatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an extreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the hydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of chemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric temperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider range of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light curves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two well-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme chemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore, alternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still to be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe.},

abstract = {We study a general framework for broadcast gossip algorithms which use companion variables to solve the average consensus problem. Each node maintains an initial state and a companion variable. Iterative updates are performed asynchronously whereby one random node broadcasts its current state and companion variable and all other nodes receiving the broadcast update their state and companion variable. We provide conditions under which this scheme is guaranteed to converge to a consensus solution, where all nodes have the same limiting values, on any strongly connected directed graph. Under stronger conditions, which are reasonable when the underlying communication graph is undirected, we guarantee that the consensus value is equal to the average, both in expectation and in the mean-squared sense. Our analysis uses tools from non-negative matrix theory and perturbation theory. The perturbation results rely on a parameter being sufficiently small. We characterize the allowable upper bound as well as the optimal setting for the perturbation parameter as a function of the network topology, and this allows us to characterize the worst-case rate of convergence. Simulations illustrate that, in comparison to existing broadcast gossip algorithms, the approaches proposed in this paper have the advantage that they simultaneously can be guaranteed to converge to the average consensus and they converge in a small number of broadcasts.},

One interesting possibility is presented by shear-free models in which the anisotropy emerges at the level of the curvature of the homogeneous spatial sections, whereas the expansion is dictated by a single scale factor. We show that such models represent viable alternatives to describe the large-scale structure of the inflationary universe, leading to a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe effect. Through the definition of a complete set of spatial eigenfunctions we compute the two-point correlation function of scalar perturbations in these models. In addition, we show how such scenarios would modify the spectrum of the CMB assuming that the observations take place in a small patch of a universe with anisotropic curvature.},

abstract = {Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.},

In this paper, we present a lower bound for the average estimation error based on the marginal distribution of X and the principal inertias of the joint distribution matrix of X and Y. Furthermore, we discuss an information measure based on the sum of the largest principal inertias, called k-correlation, which generalizes maximal correlation. We show that k-correlation satisfies the Data Processing Inequality and is convex in the conditional distribution of Y given X. Finally, we investigate how to answer a fundamental question in inference and privacy: given an observation Y, can we estimate a function f(X) of the hidden random variable X with an average error below a certain threshold? We provide a general method for answering this question using an approach based on rate-distortion theory.},

These dependencies are typically calculated using Pearson's correlation, distance correlation, and/or mutual information. However, none of these measures satisfy all the Granger's axioms for an "ideal measure". One such ideal measure, proposed by Granger himself, calculates the Bhattacharyya distance between the joint probability density function (pdf) and the product of marginal pdfs. We call this measure the mutual dependence. However, to date this measure has not been directly computable from data. In this paper, we use our recently introduced maximum likelihood non-parametric estimator for band-limited pdfs, to compute the mutual dependence directly from the data. We construct the estimator of mutual dependence and compare its performance to standard measures (Pearson's and distance correlation) for different known pdfs by computing convergence rates, computational complexity, and the ability to capture nonlinear dependencies. Our mutual dependence estimator requires fewer samples to converge to theoretical values, is faster to compute, and captures more complex dependencies than standard measures.},

abstract = {Maximum likelihood is the most widely used statistical estimation technique. Recent work by the authors introduced a general methodology for the construction of estimators for functionals in parametric models, and demonstrated improvements - both in theory and in practice - over the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), particularly in high dimensional scenarios involving parameter dimension comparable to or larger than the number of samples. This approach to estimation, building on results from approximation theory, is shown to yield minimax rate-optimal estimators for a wide class of functionals, implementable with modest computational requirements. In a nutshell, a message of this recent work is that, for a wide class of functionals, the performance of these essentially optimal estimators with \$n\$ samples is comparable to that of the MLE with \$n \backslash ln n\$ samples.   In the present paper, we highlight the applicability of the aforementioned methodology to statistical problems beyond functional estimation, and show that it can yield substantial gains. For example, we demonstrate that for learning tree-structured graphical models, our approach achieves a significant reduction of the required data size compared with the classical Chow--Liu algorithm, which is an implementation of the MLE, to achieve the same accuracy. The key step in improving the Chow--Liu algorithm is to replace the empirical mutual information with the estimator for mutual information proposed by the authors. Further, applying the same replacement approach to classical Bayesian network classification, the resulting classifiers uniformly outperform the previous classifiers on 26 widely used datasets.},

We explore the extent to which strong coupling to a single bosonic mode can alter the coherence properties of a two-level system in a structured environment. This mode is treated exactly, with the rest of the environment comprising a Markovian bath of bosonic modes. The strength of the coupling between the two-level system and the single mode is varied for a variety of different forms for the bath spectral density in order to assess whether the coherent dynamics of the two-level system are modified. We find a clear renormalisation of the site population oscillation frequency that causes an altered interaction with the bath. This leads to enhanced or reduced coherent behaviour of the two-level system depending on the form of the spectral density function. We present an intuitive interpretation, based on an analytical model, to explain the behaviour.},

abstract = {We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to a real-valued response from a probability distribution. Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). For a given total number of observations, we derive convergence rates as an explicit function of the problem difficulty. As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gartner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].},

@article{Mo2014a,
abstract = {In recent years, compressive sensing (CS) has attracted significant attention in parameter estimation tasks, including frequency estimation, time delay estimation, and localization. In order to use CS in parameter estimation, parametric dictionaries (PDs) collect observations for a sampling of the parameter space and yield sparse representations for signals of interest when the sampling is sufficiently dense. While this dense sampling can lead to high coherence in the dictionary, it is possible to leverage structured sparsity models to prevent highly coherent dictionary elements from appearing simultaneously in the signal representations, alleviating these coherence issues. However, the resulting approaches depend heavily on a careful setting of the maximum allowable coherence; furthermore, their guarantees applied on the coefficient recovery do not translate in general to the parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose the use of the earth mover's distance (EMD), as applied to a pair of true and estimated coefficient vectors, to measure the error of the parameter estimation. We formally analyze the connection between the aforementioned EMD and the parameter estimation error. We theoretically show that the EMD provides a better-suited metric for the performance of PD-based parameter estimation than the commonly used Euclidean distance. Additionally, we leverage the previously described relationship between K-median clustering and EMD-based sparse approximation to develop improved PD-based parameter estimation algorithms. Finally, we present numerical experiments that verify our theoretical results and show the performance improvements obtained from the proposed compressive parameter estimation algorithms.},

The problem is of great importance in many applications and is typically solved by maximizing the cross-correlation between the two signals. Inspired by compressive sensing, in this paper, we seek to estimate the shift directly from compressed signals. We show that under certain conditions, the shift can be recovered using fewer samples and less computation compared to the classical setup. Of particular interest is shift estimation from Fourier coefficients. We show that under rather mild conditions only one Fourier coefficient suffices to recover the true shift.},

For the two dimensional problem, we show that the artifacts are \$k\$ orders smoother than the original singularities, where \$k\$ is vanishing order of the smoothing function. Moreover, if the original singularity is conormal, then the artifacts are \$k+\backslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\$ order smoother than the original singularity.

abstract = {We report on a long-term single-dish and VLBI monitoring for intermittent flare activities of a Dominant Blue-Shifted H\$\_\{2\}\$O Maser (DBSM) associated with a southern high mass young stellar object, G353.273+0.641. Bi-weekly single-dish monitoring using Hokkaido University Tomakomai 11-m radio telescope has shown that a systematic acceleration continues over four years beyond a lifetime of individual maser features. This fact suggests that the H\$\_\{2\}\$O maser traces a region where molecular gas is steadily accelerated. There were five maser flares during five-years monitoring, and maser distributions in four of them were densely monitored by the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA). The overall distribution of the maser features suggests the presence of a bipolar jet, with the 3D kinematics indicating that it is almost face-on (inclination angle of \$\backslash sim\$ 8\$\^{}\{\backslash fdg\}\$--17\$\^{}\{\backslash fdg\}\$ from the line-of-sight). Most of maser features were recurrently excited within a region of 100\$\backslash times\$100 AU\$\^{}\{2\}\$ around the radio continuum peak, while their spatial distributions significantly varied between each flare. This confirms that episodic propagations of outflow shocks recurrently invoke intermittent flare activities. We also measured annual parallax, deriving the source distance of 1.70 \$\^{}\{+0.19\}\_\{-0.16\}\$ kpc that is consistent with the commonly-used photometric distance.},

Geo-location databases protect TV band incumbents by keeping track of TV transmitters and their protected service areas based on their location, transmission parameters and sophisticated propagation models. In this article, we argue that keeping track of both TV transmitters and TV receivers (i.e. TV sets) can achieve significant improvement in the availability of white spaces. We first identify wasted spectrum opportunities, both temporal and spatial, due to the current approach of white spaces detection. We then propose DynaWhite, a cloud-based architecture that orchestrates the detection and dissemination of highly-dynamic, real-time, and fine-grained TV white space information. DynaWhite introduces the next generation of geo-location databases by combining traditional sensing techniques with a novel unconventional sensing approach based on the detection of the passive TV receivers using standard cell phones. We present a quantitative evaluation of the potential gains in white space availability for large scale deployments of DynaWhite. We finally identify challenges that need to be addressed in the research community in order to exploit this potential for leveraging dynamic real-time fine-grained TV white spaces.},

abstract = {Atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in the local refractive index of air that accumulatively disturb a wave's phase and amplitude distribution as it propagates. This impairs the effective range of laser weapons as well as the performance of free space optical (FSO) communication systems. Adaptive optics (AO) can be applied to effectively correct wavefront distortions in weak turbulence situations. However, in strong or deep turbulence, where scintillation and beam breakup are common phenomena, traditional wavefront sensing techniques such as the use of Shack-Hartmann sensors lead to incorrect results. Consequently, the performance of AO systems will be greatly compromised. We propose a new approach that can determine the major phase distortions in a beam instantaneously and guide an AO device to compensate for the phase distortion in a few iterations. In our approach, we use a plenoptic wavefront sensor to image the distorted beam into its 4D phase space. A fast reconstruction algorithm based on graph theory is applied to recognize the phase distortion of a laser beam and command the AO device to perform phase compensation. As a result, we show in our experiments that an arbitrary phase distortion with peak to peak value up to 22\{$\backslash$pi\} can be corrected within a few iteration steps. Scintillation and branch point problems are smartly avoided by the plenoptic sensor and its fast reconstruction algorithm. In this article, we will demonstrate the function of the plenoptic sensor, the fast reconstruction algorithm as well as the beam correction improvements when our approach is applied to an AO system.},

abstract = {The problem of error correction for Gallager's low-density parity-check codes is famously equivalent to that of computing marginal Boltzmann probabilities for an Ising-like model with multispin interactions in a non-uniform magnetic field. Since the graph of interactions is locally a tree, the solution is very well approximated by a generalized mean-field (Bethe-Peierls) approximation. Belief propagation (BP) and similar iterative algorithms are an efficient way to perform the calculation, but they sometimes fail to converge, or converge to non-codewords, giving rise to a non-negligible residual error probability (error floor). On the other hand, provably-convergent algorithms are far too complex to be implemented in a real decoder. In this work we consider the application of the probability-damping technique, which can be regarded either as a variant of BP, from which it retains the property of low complexity, or as an approximation of a provably-convergent algorithm, from which it is expected to inherit better convergence properties. We investigate the algorithm behaviour on a real instance of Gallager code, and compare the results with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {The Random Demodulator (RD) and the Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) are two recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) techniques for the acquisition of continuous-time spectrally-sparse signals. They extend the standard CS paradigm from sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and possibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture these signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably similar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction algorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that compare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on spectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive radio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that the RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering, but employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate system sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions. Lastly, we show that "block convolution" is a fundamental aspect of the MWC, allowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband) signals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for continuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes detailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ, sometimes substantially, from published results.},

abstract = {The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been studied for years. The traditional ADMM algorithm needs to compute, at each iteration, an (empirical) expected loss function on all training examples, resulting in a computational complexity proportional to the number of training examples. To reduce the time complexity, stochastic ADMM algorithms were proposed to replace the expected function with a random loss function associated with one uniformly drawn example plus a Bregman divergence. The Bregman divergence, however, is derived from a simple second order proximal function, the half squared norm, which could be a suboptimal choice.   In this paper, we present a new family of stochastic ADMM algorithms with optimal second order proximal functions, which produce a new family of adaptive subgradient methods. We theoretically prove that their regret bounds are as good as the bounds which could be achieved by the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. Encouraging empirical results on a variety of real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm when applied to the compressed sensing recovery problem. We show that the algorithm has the following properties (made more precise in the main text of the paper)   - It gives near-optimal error guarantees.   - It is robust to observation noise.   - It succeeds with a minimum number of observations.   - It can be used with any sampling operator for which the operator and its adjoint can be computed.   - The memory requirement is linear in the problem size.   - Its computational complexity per iteration is of the same order as the application of the measurement operator or its adjoint.   - It requires a fixed number of iterations depending only on the logarithm of a form of signal to noise ratio of the signal.   - Its performance guarantees are uniform in that they only depend on properties of the sampling operator and signal sparsity.},

abstract = {A key aspect for any greedy pursuit algorithm used in compressed sensing is a good support-set detection method. For distributed compressed sensing, we consider a setup where many sensors measure sparse signals that are correlated via the existence of a signals' intersection support-set. This intersection support-set is called the joint support-set. Estimation of the joint support-set has a high impact on the performance of a distributed greedy pursuit algorithm. This estimation can be achieved by exchanging local support-set estimates followed by a (consensus) voting method. In this paper we endeavor for a probabilistic analysis of two democratic voting principle that we call majority and consensus voting. In our analysis, we first model the input/output relation of a greedy algorithm (executed locally in a sensor) by a single parameter known as probability of miss. Based on this model, we analyze the voting principles and prove that the democratic voting principle has a merit to detect the joint support-set.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

We show that the resulting optimization problems are equivalent, in the following sense. Given any instance of an \$\backslash ell\_2\$-loss soft-margin (or hard-margin) SVM, we construct a Lasso instance having the same optimal solutions, and vice versa.   As a consequence, many existing optimization algorithms for both SVMs and Lasso can also be applied to the respective other problem instances. Also, the equivalence allows for many known theoretical insights for SVM and Lasso to be translated between the two settings. One such implication gives a simple kernelized version of the Lasso, analogous to the kernels used in the SVM setting. Another consequence is that the sparsity of a Lasso solution is equal to the number of support vectors for the corresponding SVM instance, and that one can use screening rules to prune the set of support vectors. Furthermore, we can relate sublinear time algorithms for the two problems, and give a new such algorithm variant for the Lasso. We also study the regularization paths for both methods.},

Regardless of tensor order, MPS extracts its relevant features to the so-called core tensor of maximum order three which can be used for classification. Mainly based on a successive sequence of singular value decompositions (SVD), MPS is quite simple to implement without any recursive procedure needed for optimizing local tensors. Thus, it leads to substantial computational savings compared to other tensor feature extraction methods such as higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) underlying the Tucker decomposition (TD).

abstract = {We study the two main constituent galaxies of a constrained simulation of the Local Group as candidates for the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31). We focus on the formation of the stellar discs and its relation to the formation of the group as a rich system with two massive galaxies, and investigate the effects of mergers and accretion as drivers of morphological transformations. We use a state-of-the-art hydrodynamical code which includes star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment to carry out our study. We run two simulations, where we include or neglect the effects of radiation pressure from stars, to investigate the impact of this process on the morphologies and star formation rates of the simulated galaxies. We find that the simulated M31 and MW have different formation histories, even though both inhabit, at z=0, the same environment. These differences directly translate into and explain variations in their star formation rates, in-situ fractions and final morphologies. The M31 candidate has an active merger history, as a result of which its stellar disc is unable to survive unaffected until the present time. In contrast, the MW candidate has a smoother history with no major mergers at late times, and forms a disc that grows steadily; at z=0 the simulated MW has an extended, rotationally-supported disc which is dominant over the bulge. Our two feedback implementations predict similar evolution of the galaxies and their discs, although some variations are detected, the most important of which is the formation time of the discs: in the model with weaker/stronger feedback the discs form earlier/later. In summary, by comparing the formation histories of the two galaxies, we conclude that the particular merger/accretion history of a galaxy rather than its environment at the LG-scales is the main driver of the formation and subsequent growth or destruction of galaxy discs.},

abstract = {Binary measurements arise naturally in a variety of statistical and engineering applications. They may be inherent to the problem---e.g., in determining the relationship between genetics and the presence or absence of a disease---or they may be a result of extreme quantization. In one-bit compressed sensing it has recently been shown that the number of one-bit measurements required for signal estimation mirrors that of unquantized compressed sensing. Indeed, \$s\$-sparse signals in \$\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}n\$ can be estimated (up to normalization) from \$\backslash Omega(s \backslash log (n/s))\$ one-bit measurements. Nevertheless, controlling the precise accuracy of the error estimate remains an open challenge. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the decay of the error as a function of the oversampling factor \$\backslash lambda := m/(s \backslash log(n/s))\$, where \$m\$ is the number of measurements. It is known that the error in reconstructing sparse signals from standard one-bit measurements is bounded below by \$\backslash Omega(\backslash lambda\^{}\{-1\})\$. Without adjusting the measurement procedure, reducing this polynomial error decay rate is impossible. However, we show that an adaptive choice of the thresholds used for quantization may lower the error rate to \$e\^{}\{-\backslash Omega(\backslash lambda)\}\$. This improves upon guarantees for other methods of adaptive thresholding as proposed in Sigma-Delta quantization. We develop a general recursive strategy to achieve this exponential decay and two specific polynomial-time algorithms which fall into this framework, one based on convex programming and one on hard thresholding. This work is inspired by the one-bit compressed sensing model, in which the engineer controls the measurement procedure. Nevertheless, the principle is extendable to signal reconstruction problems in a variety of binary statistical models as well as statistical estimation problems like logistic regression.},

abstract = {In the field of compressed sensing, a key problem remains open: to explicitly construct matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) whose performance rivals those generated using random matrix theory. In short, RIP involves estimating the singular values of a combinatorially large number of submatrices, seemingly requiring an enormous amount of computation in even low-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem involving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly constructing numerically erasure robust frames (NERFs). Such frames are the latest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear encoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle difference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that allows us to introduce a new computational trick for quickly estimating NERF bounds. In short, we estimate these bounds by evaluating the frame analysis operator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow ideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and epsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of operator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results, using these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which would otherwise take an eternity. Though the more important RIP problem remains open, this work nevertheless demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting symmetry to greatly reduce the computational burden of similar combinatorial linear algebra problems.},

In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.},

abstract = {Many emerging applications involve sparse signals, and their processing is a subject of active research. We desire a large class of sensing matrices which allow the user to discern important properties of the measured sparse signal. Of particular interest are matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP). RIP matrices are known to enable efficient and stable reconstruction of sufficiently sparse signals, but the deterministic construction of such matrices has proven very difficult. In this thesis, we discuss this matrix design problem in the context of a growing field of study known as frame theory. In the first two chapters, we build large families of equiangular tight frames and full spark frames, and we discuss their relationship to RIP matrices as well as their utility in other aspects of sparse signal processing. In Chapter 3, we pave the road to deterministic RIP matrices, evaluating various techniques to demonstrate RIP, and making interesting connections with graph theory and number theory. We conclude in Chapter 4 with a coherence-based alternative to RIP, which provides near-optimal probabilistic guarantees for various aspects of sparse signal processing while at the same time admitting a whole host of deterministic constructions.},

abstract = {Sparse approximations using highly over-complete dictionaries is a state-of-the-art tool for many imaging applications including denoising, super-resolution, compressive sensing, light-field analysis, and object recognition. Unfortunately, the applicability of such methods is severely hampered by the computational burden of sparse approximation: these algorithms are linear or super-linear in both the data dimensionality and size of the dictionary. We propose a framework for learning the hierarchical structure of over-complete dictionaries that enables fast computation of sparse representations. Our method builds on tree-based strategies for nearest neighbor matching, and presents domain-specific enhancements that are highly efficient for the analysis of image patches. Contrary to most popular methods for building spatial data structures, out methods rely on shallow, balanced trees with relatively few layers. We show an extensive array of experiments on several applications such as image denoising/superresolution, compressive video/light-field sensing where we practically achieve 100-1000x speedup (with a less than 1dB loss in accuracy).},

We determine the class of probability distributions for which kernels induced by semimetrics are characteristic (that is, for which embeddings of the distributions to an RKHS are injective). Finally, we investigate the performance of this family of kernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular that the energy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one member of a parametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this family can yield more powerful tests.},

abstract = {The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) nonoverlapping groups of features. The nonoverlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. Our methods and theoretical results are then generalized to tackle the general overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the l(q) norm. We further extend our algorithm to solve a nonconvex overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the capped norm regularization, which reduces the estimation bias introduced by the convex penalty. We have performed empirical evaluations using both a synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression dataset, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the nonconvex formulation for overlapping group Lasso.},

Metamaterials can provide a wide range of linear optical properties such as negative refractive index, hyperbolic dispersion, or magnetic behavior at optical frequencies. Nonlinear optical properties, however, have only been demonstrated for patterned metallic films which suffer from high optical losses. Here we show that second-order nonlinear metamaterials can also be obtained from non-metallic centrosymmetric constituents with inherently low optical absorption. In our proof-of-principle experiments, we have iterated atomic-layer deposition (ALD) of three different constituents, A = Al\$\_2\$O\$\_3\$, B = TiO\$\_2\$ and C = HfO\$\_2\$. The centrosymmetry of the resulting ABC stack is broken since the ABC and the inverted CBA sequences are not equivalent - a necessary condition for non-zero second-order nonlinearity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first realization of a bulk nonlinear optical metamaterial.},

abstract = {This research aims to identify strong structural features of real-world complex networks, sufficient to enable a host of graph algorithms that are much more efficient than what is possible for general graphs (and currently used for network analysis). Specifically, we study the property of bounded expansion. This is the strongest formalization of the well-observed notion of "sparsity" that might possibly apply to real-world networks and allow many previously intractable problems to become tractable. On the theoretical side, we analyze many previously proposed models for random networks and characterize which ones have bounded expansion. We show that, w.h.p., (1) graphs sampled with either the Molloy-Reed configuration model (including a variation of the model which achieves high clustering) or the Chung-Lu model with a prescribed sparse degree sequence (including heavy-tailed degree distributions); (2) perturbed bounded-degree graphs; (3) stochastic block models with small probabilities; result in graphs of bounded expansion. We also prove that the Kleinberg model and the Barabasi-Albert model, in typical setups, contain large one-subdivisions of cliques and thus do not result in graphs of bounded expansion. On the practical side, we give experimental evidence that many complex networks have bounded expansion, by measuring the closely related "low treedepth coloring number" on a corpus of real-world data. On the algorithmic side, we show how tools provided by the bounded expansion framework can be used to efficiently solve the following common network analysis problems: for a fixed graph H, we obtain the fastest-known algorithm for counting the number of induced H-subgraphs and the number of H-homomorphisms; and we design linear algorithms for computing several centrality measures.},

In the form of conditional expectation the Bayesian update becomes computationally attractive. This is especially the case as together with a functional or spectral approach for the forward UQ there is no need for time-consuming and slowly convergent Monte Carlo sampling. The developed sampling-free non-linear Bayesian update is derived from the variational problem associated with conditional expectation. This formulation in general calls for further discretisation to make the computation possible, and we choose a polynomial approximation. After giving details on the actual computation in the framework of functional or spectral approximations, we demonstrate the workings of the algorithm on a number of examples of increasing complexity. At last, we compare the linear and quadratic Bayesian update on the small but taxing example of the chaotic Lorenz 84 model, where we experiment with the influence of different observation or measurement operators on the update.},

First, we construct a natural topological correspondence between relative cycles in \$H\_n(X-Y\_a,\backslash cup D-Y\_a)\$ bounded by the union of \$G\$-invariant divisors \$\backslash cup D\$ in \$X\$ to the solution sheaf of \$\backslash tau\$, in the form of chain integrals. Applying this to a toric variety with torus action, we show that in addition to the period integrals over cycles in \$Y\_a\$, the new chain integrals generate the full solution sheaf of a GKZ system. This extends an earlier result for hypersurfaces in a projective homogeneous variety, whereby the chains are cycles. In light of this result, the mixed Hodge structure of the solution sheaf is now seen as the MHS of \$H\_n(X-Y\_a,\backslash cup D-Y\_a)\$. In addition, we generalize the result on chain integral solutions to the case of general type hypersurfaces. This chain integral correspondence can also be seen as the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in one homological degree. Finally, we consider interesting cases in which the chain integral correspondence possibly fails to be bijective.},

abstract = {The study of the optimality of low-complexity greedy scheduling techniques in wireless communications networks is a very complex problem. The Local Pooling (LoP) factor provides a single-parameter means of expressing the achievable capacity region (and optimality) of one such scheme, greedy maximal scheduling (GMS). The exact LoP factor for an arbitrary network graph is generally difficult to obtain, but may be evaluated or bounded based on the network graph's particular structure. In this paper, we provide rigorous characterizations of the LoP factor in large networks modeled as Erd$\backslash$H\{o\}s-R$\backslash$'enyi (ER) and random geometric (RG) graphs under the primary interference model. We employ threshold functions to establish critical values for either the edge probability or communication radius to yield useful bounds on the range and expectation of the LoP factor as the network grows large. For sufficiently dense random graphs, we find that the LoP factor is between 1/2 and 2/3, while sufficiently sparse random graphs permit GMS optimality (the LoP factor is 1) with high probability. We then place LoP within a larger context of commonly studied random graph properties centered around connectedness. We observe that edge densities permitting connectivity generally admit cycle subgraphs which forms the basis for the LoP factor upper bound of 2/3. We conclude with simulations to explore the regime of small networks, which suggest the probability that an ER or RG graph satisfies LoP and is connected decays quickly in network size.},

abstract = {This paper examines online distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The goal is to distributively optimize a global objective function over a network of decision makers under linear constraints. The global objective function is composed of convex cost functions associated with each agent. The local cost functions, on the other hand, are assumed to have been decomposed into two distinct convex functions, one of which is revealed to the decision makers over time and one known a priori. In addition, the agents must achieve consensus on the global variable that relates to the private local variables via linear constraints. In this work, we extend online ADMM to a distributed setting based on dual-averaging and distributed gradient descent. We then propose a performance metric for such online distributed algorithms and explore the performance of the sequence of decisions generated by the algorithm as compared with the best fixed decision in hindsight. This performance metric is called the social regret. A sub-linear upper bound on the social regret of the proposed algorithm is then obtained that underscores the role of the underlying network topology and certain condition measures associated with the linear constraints. The online distributed ADMM algorithm is then applied to a formation acquisition problem demonstrating the application of the proposed setup in distributed robotics.},

While most denoising procedures require some knowledge about the noise level, which may be unknown in practice, here we assume that the signal expansion in a given dictionary has a distribution that is more heavy-tailed than the noise. We show how this hypothesis leads to a stopping criterion for greedy pursuit algorithms which is independent from the noise level. Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning, we propose a strategy to reduce the variance of greedy estimates by averaging pursuits obtained from randomly subsampled dictionaries. We call this denoising procedure Blind Random Pursuit Denoising (BIRD). We offer a generalization to multidimensional signals, with a structured sparse model (S-BIRD). The relevance of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental MEG signals where, without any parameter tuning, BIRD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when they are informed by the noise level.

Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of significant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical physics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of models. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with \$p\$ nodes of degree at most \$d\$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the \$p\^{}\{d\}\$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node.   In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of \$p\^{}2\$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information. This structural property may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {In this paper, we put forth distributed algorithms for solving loosely coupled unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. Such problems are usually solved using algorithms that are based on a combination of decomposition and first order methods. These algorithms are commonly very slow and require many iterations to converge. In order to alleviate this issue, we propose algorithms that combine the Newton and interior-point methods with proximal splitting methods for solving such problems. Particularly, the algorithm for solving unconstrained loosely coupled problems, is based on Newton's method and utilizes proximal splitting to distribute the computations for calculating the Newton step at each iteration. A combination of this algorithm and the interior-point method is then used to introduce a distributed algorithm for solving constrained loosely coupled problems. We also provide guidelines on how to implement the proposed methods efficiently and briefly discuss the properties of the resulting solutions.},

Furthermore, a muscle-distribution-based (MD) model is proposed, which utilizes the muscle distribution of the human face and results in more accurate facial illumination details. In addition, we also propose a new distance-based metric to automatically select the optimal parameters such that the global and local warping effects in the elastic model can be suitably balanced.

@article{Lockhart2014,
abstract = {In the sparse linear regression setting, we consider testing the significance of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model, in the sequence of models visited along the lasso solution path. We propose a simple test statistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic, and show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an Exp(1) asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the null being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso model). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to enter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable against the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix X. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places further technical assumptions on X and the generative model, but still allows for the important high-dimensional case p > n, and does not necessarily require that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active variables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test, comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a [Formula: see text] distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than [Formula: see text] under the null hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter $\lambda$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active variables are shrunken due to the [Formula: see text] penalty. Therefore, the test statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by these two opposing properties-adaptivity and shrinkage-and its null distribution is tractable and asymptotically Exp(1).},

We model the temperature dynamics of the transmitter as a linear system and determine the optimal transmit power policy under such temperature constraints as well as energy harvesting constraints over an AWGN channel. We first derive the structural properties of the solution for the general case with multiple energy arrivals. We show that the optimal power policy is piecewise monotone decreasing with possible jumps at the energy harvesting instants. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal solution in the single energy arrival case. We show that, in the single energy arrival case, the optimal power is monotone decreasing, the resulting temperature is monotone increasing, and both remain constant after the temperature hits the critical level. We then generalize the solution for the multiple energy arrival case.},

abstract = {Nonconvex and structured optimization problems arise in many engineering applications that demand scalable and distributed solution methods. The study of the convergence properties of these methods is in general difficult due to the nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributed solution methods that combine the fast convergence properties of augmented Lagrangian-based methods with the separability properties of alternating optimization are investigated. The first method is adapted from the classic quadratic penalty function method and is called the Alternating Direction Penalty Method (ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method, in which single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating optimization, which in turn makes it scalable. The second method is the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that ADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible point under mild conditions and an additional condition ensuring that it asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local optimality are introduced. In the case of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under which the algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions are established. Based on this, complete convergence of ADMM for a class of low dimensional problems are characterized. Finally, the results are illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization problem in wireless sensor networks.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide invaluable information about the structure of different tissue types in the brain. Standard dMRI acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of medium-to-large white matter bundles. However, smaller fiber bundles connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet, the ability to trace such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work, we propose a novel acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images, which is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method called compressed-sensing super resolution reconstruction (CS-SRR), uses multiple overlapping thick-slice dMRI volumes that are under-sampled in q-space to reconstruct diffusion signal with complex orientations. The proposed method combines the twin concepts of compressed sensing and super-resolution to model the diffusion signal (at a given b-value) in a basis of spherical ridgelets with total-variation (TV) regularization to account for signal correlation in neighboring voxels. A computationally efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is introduced for solving the CS-SRR problem. The performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on several in-vivo human data sets including a true SRR scenario. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for reconstructing sub-millimeter super resolution dMRI data with very good data fidelity in clinically feasible acquisition time.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of learning the graph structure underlying a discrete undirected graphical model from i.i.d. samples. We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of \$\backslash Omega (p\^{}\{d/2\})\$ for learning general graphical models on \$p\$ nodes of maximum degree \$d\$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the \$O(p\^{}d)\$ runtime required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models.   Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree, hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models that have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient learning in time \$O(p\^{}2)\$. We provide an algorithm whose performance interpolates between \$O(p\^{}2)\$ and \$O(p\^{}\{d+2\})\$ depending on the strength of the repulsion.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a parallel and distributed extension to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving convex problem: minimize \$\backslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}N f\_i(x\_i)\$ subject to \$\backslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}N A\_i x\_i=c, x\_i\backslash in \backslash mathcal\{X\}\_i\$. The algorithm decomposes the original problem into N smaller subproblems and solves them in parallel at each iteration. This Jacobian-type algorithm is well suited for distributed computing and is particularly attractive for solving certain large-scale problems.   This paper introduces a few novel results. Firstly, it shows that extending ADMM straightforwardly from the classic Gauss-Seidel setting to the Jacobian setting, from 2 blocks to N blocks, will preserve convergence if matrices \$A\_i\$ are mutually near-orthogonal and have full column-rank. Secondly, for general matrices \$A\_i\$, this paper proposes to add proximal terms of different kinds to the N subproblems so that the subproblems can be solved in flexible and efficient ways and the algorithm converges globally at a rate of o(1/k). Thirdly, a simple technique is introduced to improve some existing convergence rates from O(1/k) to o(1/k).   In practice, some conditions in our convergence theorems are conservative. Therefore, we introduce a strategy for dynamically tuning the parameters in the algorithm, leading to substantial acceleration of the convergence in practice. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with several existing parallel algorithms.   We implemented our algorithm on Amazon EC2, an on-demand public computing cloud, and report its performance on very large-scale basis pursuit problems with distributed data.},

In this context, previous studies have considered fixed inter-antenna distance, which implies an increasing array aperture as the number of elements increases. Here, we focus on a practical, space-constrained topology, where an increase in the number of antenna elements in a fixed total space imposes an inversely proportional decrease in the inter-antenna distance. Our analysis shows that, contrary to existing studies, inter-user interference does not vanish in the massive MIMO regime, thereby creating a saturation effect on the achievable rate.},

abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to consistently compare the assembly of dwarf galaxies in both \$\backslash Lambda\$ dominated, Cold (CDM) and Self--Interacting (SIDM) dark matter models. The SIDM model adopts a constant cross section of 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$, a relatively large value to maximize its effects. These are the first SIDM simulations that are combined with a description of stellar feedback that naturally drives potential fluctuations able to create dark matter cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower the central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 Km/s. This is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos have relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time scales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback. At a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and SIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc. At larger halo masses (\$\backslash sim\$ 10\$\^{}\{10\}\$ solar masses), the introduction of baryonic processes creates field dwarf galaxies with dark matter cores and central DM\$+\$baryon distributions that are effectively indistinguishable between CDM and SIDM. Both models are in broad agreement with observed Local Group field galaxies across the range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate SIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross section that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$ for halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced.},

As a result, our optimally tuned algorithms dominate such proposals. Our notion of optimality is defined in terms of phase transitions, i.e. we maximize the number of nonzeros at which the algorithm can successfully operate. We show that the phase transition is a well-defined quantity with our suite of random underdetermined linear systems.

Instead of computing a single sparse most probable (MAP) solution as in standard deterministic approaches, the focus in the Bayesian compressed sensing framework shifts towards capturing the full posterior distribution on the latent variables, which allows quantifying the estimation uncertainty and learning model parameters using maximum likelihood. The exact posterior distribution under the sparse linear model is intractable and we concentrate on variational Bayesian techniques to approximate it. Repeatedly computing Gaussian variances turns out to be a key requisite and constitutes the main computational bottleneck in applying variational techniques in large-scale problems. We leverage on the recently proposed Perturb-and-MAP algorithm for drawing exact samples from Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF). The main technical contribution of our paper is to show that estimating Gaussian variances using a relatively small number of such efficiently drawn random samples is much more effective than alternative general-purpose variance estimation techniques. By reducing the problem of variance estimation to standard optimization primitives, the resulting variational algorithms are fully scalable and parallelizable, allowing Bayesian computations in extremely large-scale problems with the same memory and time complexity requirements as conventional point estimation techniques. We illustrate these ideas with experiments in image deblurring.},

abstract = {Sirius has always attracted a lot of scientific interest, especially after the discovery of a companion white dwarf at the end of the 19th century. Very early on, the existence of a potential third body was put forward to explain some of the observed properties of the system. We present new coronagraphic observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE that explore, for the very first time, the innermost regions of the system down to 0.2" (0.5 AU) from Sirius A. Our observations cover the near-infrared from 0.95 to 2.3 \$\backslash mu\$m and they offer the best on-sky contrast ever reached at these angular separations. After detailing the steps of our SPHERE/IRDIFS data analysis, we present a robust method to derive detection limits for multi-spectral data from high-contrast imagers and spectrographs. In terms of raw performance, we report contrasts of 14.3 mag at 0.2", \~{}16.3 mag in the 0.4-1.0" range and down to 19 mag at 3.7". In physical units, our observations are sensitive to giant planets down to 11 \$M\_\{Jup\}\$ at 0.5 AU, 6-7 \$M\_\{Jup\}\$ in the 1-2 AU range and \~{}4 \$M\_\{Jup\}\$ at 10 AU. Despite the exceptional sensitivity of our observations, we do not report the detection of additional companions around Sirius A. Using a Monte Carlo orbital analysis, we show that we can reject, with about 50\% probability, the existence of an 8 \$M\_\{Jup\}\$ planet orbiting at 1 AU. In addition to the results presented in the paper, we provide our SPHERE/IFS data reduction pipeline at http://people.lam.fr/vigan.arthur/ under the MIT license.},

abstract = {In this work, we focus on separable convex optimization problems with box constraints and a set of triangular linear constraints. The solution is given in closed-form as a function of some Lagrange multipliers that can be computed through an iterative procedure in a finite number of steps. Graphical interpretations are given casting valuable insights into the proposed algorithm and allowing to retain some of the intuition spelled out by the water-filling policy. It turns out that it is not only general enough to compute the solution to different instances of the problem at hand but also remarkably simple in the way it operates. We also show how some power allocation problems in signal processing and communications can be solved with the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i) variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii) uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

abstract = {Sufficient conditions are developed, under which the compound Poisson distribution has maximal entropy within a natural class of probability measures on the nonnegative integers. Recently, one of the authors [O. Johnson, \{$\backslash$em Stoch. Proc. Appl.\}, 2007] used a semigroup approach to show that the Poisson has maximal entropy among all ultra-log-concave distributions with fixed mean. We show via a non-trivial extension of this semigroup approach that the natural analog of the Poisson maximum entropy property remains valid if the compound Poisson distributions under consideration are log-concave, but that it fails in general. A parallel maximum entropy result is established for the family of compound binomial measures. Sufficient conditions for compound distributions to be log-concave are discussed and applications to combinatorics are examined; new bounds are derived on the entropy of the cardinality of a random independent set in a claw-free graph, and a connection is drawn to Mason's conjecture for matroids. The present results are primarily motivated by the desire to provide an information-theoretic foundation for compound Poisson approximation and associated limit theorems, analogous to the corresponding developments for the central limit theorem and for Poisson approximation. Our results also demonstrate new links between some probabilistic methods and the combinatorial notions of log-concavity and ultra-log-concavity, and they add to the growing body of work exploring the applications of maximum entropy characterizations to problems in discrete mathematics.},

abstract = {It was recently shown that estimating the Shannon entropy \$H(\{\backslash rm p\})\$ of a discrete \$k\$-symbol distribution \$\{\backslash rm p\}\$ requires \$\backslash Theta(k/\backslash log k)\$ samples, a number that grows near-linearly in the support size. In many applications \$H(\{\backslash rm p\})\$ can be replaced by the more general R$\backslash$'enyi entropy of order \$\backslash alpha\$, \$H\_\backslash alpha(\{\backslash rm p\})\$. We determine the number of samples needed to estimate \$H\_\backslash alpha(\{\backslash rm p\})\$ for all \$\backslash alpha\$, showing that \$\backslash alpha < 1\$ requires a super-linear, roughly \$k\^{}\{1/\backslash alpha\}\$ samples, noninteger \$\backslash alpha>1\$ requires a near-linear \$k\$ samples, but, perhaps surprisingly, integer \$\backslash alpha>1\$ requires only \$\backslash Theta(k\^{}\{1-1/\backslash alpha\})\$ samples. Furthermore, developing on a recently established connection between polynomial approximation and estimation of additive functions of the form \$\backslash sum\_\{x\} f(\{\backslash rm p\}\_x)\$, we reduce the sample complexity for noninteger values of \$\backslash alpha\$ by a factor of \$\backslash log k\$ compared to the empirical estimator. The estimators achieving these bounds are simple and run in time linear in the number of samples. Our lower bounds provide explicit constructions of distributions with different R$\backslash$'enyi entropies that are hard to distinguish.},

In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a partially observed guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

Group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of items into pools. Each pool is then tested to identify the defective items, which are usually assumed to be "sparse". We consider non-adaptive randomly pooling measurements, where pools are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. We also consider a model where noisy measurements allow for both some false negative and some false positive test outcomes (and also allow for asymmetric noise, and activation noise). We consider three classes of algorithms for the group testing problem (we call them specifically the "Coupon Collector Algorithm", the "Column Matching Algorithms", and the "LP Decoding Algorithms" -- the last two classes of algorithms (versions of some of which had been considered before in the literature) were inspired by corresponding algorithms in the Compressive Sensing literature. The second and third of these algorithms have several flavours, dealing separately with the noiseless and noisy measurement scenarios. Our contribution is novel analysis to derive explicit sample-complexity bounds -- with all constants expressly computed -- for these algorithms as a function of the desired error probability; the noise parameters; the number of items; and the size of the defective set (or an upper bound on it). We also compare the bounds to information-theoretic lower bounds for sample complexity based on Fano's inequality and show that the upper and lower bounds are equal up to an explicitly computable universal constant factor (independent of problem parameters).},

abstract = {A central problem in the operation of large wireless networks is how to deal with interference -- the unwanted signals being sent by transmitters that a receiver is not interested in. This thesis looks at ways of combating such interference.   In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and communication theory background, including the concept of capacity. We also include an overview of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as interference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based strategy called ergodic interference alignment.   In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks by treating interference as background noise. We consider the local performance of a single node, and the global performance of a very large network.   In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the asymptotic sum-capacity of large random dense networks. These networks are derived from a physical model of node placement where signal strength decays over the distance between transmitters and receivers. (See also arXiv:1002.0235 and arXiv:0907.5165.)   In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long time delays incurred by ergodic interference alignment. We analyse the tradeoff between reducing delay and lowering the communication rate. (See also arXiv:1004.0208.)   In Chapter 6, we outline a problem that is equivalent to the problem of pooled group testing for defective items. We then present some new work that uses information theoretic techniques to attack group testing. We introduce for the first time the concept of the group testing channel, which allows for modelling of a wide range of statistical error models for testing. We derive new results on the number of tests required to accurately detect defective items, including when using sequential `adaptive' tests.},

abstract = {HI intensity mapping is a new observational technique to map fluctuations in the large-scale structure of matter using the 21 cm emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI). Sensitive radio surveys have the potential to detect Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at low redshifts (z < 1) in order to constrain the properties of dark energy. Observations of the HI signal will be contaminated by instrumental noise and, more significantly, by astrophysical foregrounds, such as Galactic synchrotron emission, which is at least four orders of magnitude brighter than the HI signal. Foreground cleaning is recognised as one of the key challenges for future radio astronomy surveys. We study the ability of the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method to subtract radio foregrounds and to recover the cosmological HI signal for a general HI intensity mapping experiment. The GNILC method is a new technique that uses both frequency and spatial information to separate the components of the observed data. Our results show that the method is robust to the complexity of the foregrounds. For simulated radio observations including HI emission, Galactic synchrotron, Galactic free-free, radio sources and 0.05 mK thermal noise, we find that we can reconstruct the HI power spectrum for multipoles 30 < l < 150 with 6\% accuracy on 50\% of the sky for a redshift z \~{} 0.25.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been rapid progress on understanding Gaussian networks with multiple unicast connections, and new coding techniques have emerged. The essence of multi-source networks is how to efficiently manage interference that arises from the transmission of other sessions. Classically, interference is removed by orthogonalization (in time or frequency). This means that the rate per session drops inversely proportional to the number of sessions, suggesting that interference is a strong limiting factor in such networks. However, recently discovered interference management techniques have led to a paradigm shift that interference might not be quite as detrimental after all. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of these new coding techniques as they apply to the case of time-varying Gaussian networks with multiple unicast connections. Specifically, we review interference alignment and ergodic interference alignment for multi-source single-hop networks and interference neutralization and ergodic interference neutralization for multi-source multi-hop networks. We mainly focus on the ``degrees of freedom'' perspective and also discuss an approximate capacity characterization.},

abstract = {We present a tutorial on reduced-rank signal processing, design methods and algorithms for dimensionality reduction, and cover a number of important applications. A general framework based on linear algebra and linear estimation is employed to introduce the reader to the fundamentals of reduced-rank signal processing and to describe how dimensionality reduction is performed on an observed discrete-time signal. A unified treatment of dimensionality reduction algorithms is presented with the aid of least squares optimization techniques, in which several techniques for designing the transformation matrix that performs dimensionality reduction are reviewed. Among the dimensionality reduction techniques are those based on the eigen-decomposition of the observed data vector covariance matrix, Krylov subspace methods, joint and iterative optimization (JIO) algorithms and JIO with simplified structures and switching (JIOS) techniques. A number of applications are then considered using a unified treatment, which includes wireless communications, sensor and array signal processing, and speech, audio, image and video processing. This tutorial concludes with a discussion of future research directions and emerging topics.},

abstract = {Consider the approximate sparse recovery problem: given Ax, where A is a known m-by-n dimensional matrix and x is an unknown (approximately) sparse n-dimensional vector, recover an approximation to x. The goal is to design the matrix A such that m is small and recovery is efficient. Moreover, it is often desirable for A to have other nice properties, such as explicitness, sparsity, and discreteness.   In this work, we show that we can use spectral expander graphs to explicitly design binary matrices A for which the column sparsity is optimal and for which there is an efficient recovery algorithm (l1-minimization). In order to recover x that is close to \{$\backslash$delta\}n-sparse (where \{$\backslash$delta\} is a constant), we design an explicit binary matrix A that has m = O(sqrt\{\{$\backslash$delta\}\} log(1/\{$\backslash$delta\}) * n) rows and has O(log(1/\{$\backslash$delta\})) ones in each column. Previous such constructions were based on unbalanced bipartite graphs with high vertex expansion, for which we currently do not have explicit constructions. In particular, ours is the first explicit non-trivial construction of a measurement matrix A such that Ax can be computed in O(n log(1/\{$\backslash$delta\})) time.},

abstract = {In this paper, stability of linearly coupled dynamical systems with feedback pinning algorithm is studied. Here, both the coupling matrix and the set of pinned-nodes vary with time, induced by a continuous-time Markov chain with finite states. Event-triggered rules are employed on both diffusion coupling and feedback pinning terms, which can efficiently reduce the computation load, as well as communication load in some cases and be realized by the latest observations of the state information of its local neighborhood and the target trajectory. The next observation is triggered by certain criterion (event) based on these state information as well. Two scenarios are considered: the continuous monitoring, that each node observes the state information of its neighborhood and target (if pinned) in an instantaneous way, to determine the next triggering event time, and the discrete monitoring, that each node needs only to observe the state information at the last event time and predict the next triggering-event time. In both cases, we present several event-triggering rules and prove that if the conditions that the coupled system with persistent coupling and control can be stabilized are satisfied, then these event-trigger strategies can stabilize the system, and Zeno behaviors are excluded in some cases. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

abstract = {Diffusion processes have been widely used for approximations in the queueing theory. There are different types of diffusion approximations. Among them, we are interested in those obtained through limits of a sequence of models which describe queueing networks. Such a limit is typically obtained by the weak convergence of either stochastic processes or stationary distributions. We already have nice reviews and text books for them. However, this area is still actively studied, and it seems getting hard to have a comprehensive overview because mathematical results are highly technical. We try to fill this gap presenting technical background. Although those diffusion approximations have been well developed, there remains a big problem, which is difficulty to get useful information from the limiting diffusion processes. Their state spaces are multidimensional, whose dimension corresponds to the number of nodes for a single-class case and the number of customer types for a multi-class case. We now have a better view for the two dimensional case, but still know very little about the higher dimensional case. This intractability is somehow against a spirit of diffusion approximation. This motivates us to reconsider diffusion approximation from scratch. For this, we highlight the stationary distributions, and make clear a mechanism to produce diffusion approximations.},

However, compared with event recognition in videos, there are much fewer research works on event recognition in images. This paper addresses the issue of event recognition from images and proposes an effective method with deep neural networks. Specifically, we design a new architecture, called Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Network (OS-CNN). This architecture is decomposed into object net and scene net, which extract useful information for event understanding from the perspective of objects and scene context, respectively. Meanwhile, we investigate different network architectures for OS-CNN design, and adapt the deep (AlexNet) and very-deep (GoogLeNet) networks to the task of event recognition. Furthermore, we find that the deep and very-deep networks are complementary to each other. Finally, based on the proposed OS-CNN and comparative study of different network architectures, we come up with a solution of five-stream CNN for the track of cultural event recognition at the ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge 2015. Our method obtains the performance of 85.5\% and ranks the \$1\^{}\{st\}\$ place in this challenge.},

Indeed, the LND-filtration gives a very precise understanding of these structure, it is impeccable for the computation of the Makar-Limanov invariant, and it is an efficient tool to determine their isomorphism types and automorphism groups. Then, we construct a new interesting class of semi-rigid k-domains in which we elaborate the fundamental requirement of LND-filtrations. The importance of these new examples is due to the fact that they possess a relatively big set of invariant sub-algebras, which can not be recoverd by known invariants such as the Makar-Limanov and the Derksen invariants. Also, we define a new family of invariant sub-algebras as a generalization of the Derksen invariant. Finally, we introduce an algorithm to establish explicit isomorphisms between cylinders over non-isomorphic members of the new class, providing by that new counter-examples to the cancellation problem.},

To do so, we extend the theory of finite-dimensional two-timescale stochastic approximation to an infinite-dimensional, Banach space setting, and we prove that the continuous dynamics of the process converge to equilibrium in the case of potential games.

Secondly in the limit \$n\backslash rightarrow\backslash infty\$ we show that any nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian of a chain of \$n\$ qubits has a Gaussian density of states; thus as far as the eigenvalues are concerned the system is like a non-interacting one. The comparison applies to chains of qubits with translationally invariant nearest-neighbour interactions, but we show that it is extendible to much more general systems (both in terms of the local dimension and the geometry of interaction). Numerical evidence is also presented which suggests that the translational invariance condition may be dropped in the case of nearest-neighbour chains.},

abstract = {Many Bayesian inference problems require exploring the posterior distribution of high-dimensional parameters that represent the discretization of an underlying function. This work introduces a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that can adapt to the particular structure of a posterior distribution over functions. Two distinct lines of research intersect in the methods developed here. First, we introduce a general class of operator-weighted proposal distributions that are well defined on function space, such that the performance of the resulting MCMC samplers is independent of the discretization of the function. Second, by exploiting local Hessian information and any associated low-dimensional structure in the change from prior to posterior distributions, we develop an inhomogeneous discretization scheme for the Langevin stochastic differential equation that yields operator-weighted proposals adapted to the non-Gaussian structure of the posterior. The resulting dimension-independent, likelihood-informed (DILI) MCMC samplers may be useful for a large class of high-dimensional problems where the target probability measure has a density with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. Two nonlinear inverse problems are used to demonstrate the efficiency of these DILI samplers: an elliptic PDE coefficient inverse problem and path reconstruction in a conditioned diffusion.},

abstract = {This paper provides an extension of compressed sensing which bridges a substantial gap between existing theory and its current use in real-world applications. It introduces a mathematical framework that generalizes the three standard pillars of compressed sensing - namely, sparsity, incoherence and uniform random subsampling - to three new concepts: asymptotic sparsity, asymptotic incoherence and multilevel random sampling. The new theorems show that compressed sensing is also possible, and reveals several advantages, under these substantially relaxed conditions. The importance of this is threefold. First, inverse problems to which compressed sensing is currently applied are typically coherent. The new theory provides the first comprehensive mathematical explanation for a range of empirical usages of compressed sensing in real-world applications, such as medical imaging, microscopy, spectroscopy and others. Second, in showing that compressed sensing does not require incoherence, but instead that asymptotic incoherence is sufficient, the new theory offers markedly greater flexibility in the design of sensing mechanisms. Third, by using asymptotic incoherence and multi-level sampling to exploit not just sparsity, but also structure, i.e. asymptotic sparsity, the new theory shows that substantially improved reconstructions can be obtained from fewer measurements.},

abstract = {We develop connections between Stein's approximation method, logarithmic Sobolev and transport inequalities by introducing a new class of functional inequalities involving the relative entropy, the Stein kernel, the relative Fisher information and the Wasserstein distance with respect to a given reference distribution on \$\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}d\$. For the Gaussian model, the results improve upon the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the Talagrand quadratic transportation cost inequality. Further examples of illustrations include multidimensional gamma distributions, beta distributions, as well as families of log-concave densities. As a by-product, the new inequalities are shown to be relevant towards convergence to equilibrium, concentration inequalities and entropic convergence expressed in terms of the Stein kernel. The tools rely on semigroup interpolation and bounds, in particular by means of the iterated gradients of the Markov generator with invariant measure the distribution under consideration. In a second part, motivated by the recent investigation by Nourdin, Peccati and Swan on Wiener chaoses, we address the issue of entropic bounds on multidimensional functionals \$F\$ with the Stein kernel via a set of data on \$F\$ and its gradients rather than on the Fisher information of the density. A natural framework for this investigation is given by the Markov Triple structure \$(E, \backslash mu, \backslash Gamma)\$ in which abstract Malliavin-type arguments may be developed and extend the Wiener chaos setting.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) aims at estimating the direction of maximal variability of a high-dimensional dataset. A natural question is: does this task become easier, and estimation more accurate, when we exploit additional knowledge on the principal vector? We study the case in which the principal vector is known to lie in the positive orthant. Similar constraints arise in a number of applications, ranging from analysis of gene expression data to spike sorting in neural signal processing.   In the unconstrained case, the estimation performances of PCA has been precisely characterized using random matrix theory, under a statistical model known as the `spiked model.' It is known that the estimation error undergoes a phase transition as the signal-to-noise ratio crosses a certain threshold. Unfortunately, tools from random matrix theory have no bearing on the constrained problem. Despite this challenge, we develop an analogous characterization in the constrained case, within a one-spike model.   In particular: \$(i)\$\~{}We prove that the estimation error undergoes a similar phase transition, albeit at a different threshold in signal-to-noise ratio that we determine exactly; \$(ii)\$\~{}We prove that --unlike in the unconstrained case-- estimation error depends on the spike vector, and characterize the least favorable vectors; \$(iii)\$\~{}We show that a non-negative principal component can be approximately computed --under the spiked model-- in nearly linear time. This despite the fact that the problem is non-convex and, in general, NP-hard to solve exactly.},

We completely classify the phase behaviour, including necessary and sufficient conditions for the model to come down from infinity.   We believe that two of our phases are new to Lambda-coalescent theory and directly reflect the incorporation of space into our model. Firstly, our semicritical phase sees a null but non-empty set of dust. In this phase the dust becomes a random fractal, of a type which is closely related to iterated function systems. Secondly, our model has a critical phase in which the coalescent comes down from infinity gradually during a bounded, deterministic time interval.},

Using an optically adressable charge and spin storage device we tailor the relative electron and hole tunneling escape timescales from the dot and simultaneously achieve high-fidelity initialization, long hole storage times and high efficiency readout via a photocurrent signal. We measure electric field-dependent Rabi oscillations of the neutral and charged exciton transitions in the ultrafast tunneling regime and demonstrate that tunneling induced dephasing (TID) of excitonic Rabi rotations is the major source for the intensity damping of Rabi oscillations in the low Rabi frequency, low temperature regime. Our results are in very good quantitative agreement with quantum-optical simulations revealing that TID can be used to precisely measure tunneling escape times and extract changes in the Coulomb binding energies for different charge configurations of the quantum dot. Finally, we demonstrate that for sub-picosecond electron tunneling escape TID of a coherently driven exciton transition facilitates ultrafast hole spin initialization with near-unity fidelity.},

abstract = {The lasso is a popular tool for sparse linear regression, especially for problems in which the number of variables p exceeds the number of observations n. But when p>n, the lasso criterion is not strictly convex, and hence it may not have a unique minimum. An important question is: when is the lasso solution well-defined (unique)? We review results from the literature, which show that if the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one, regardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends easily to \$\backslash ell\_1\$ penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss functions.   A second important question is: how can we deal with the case of non-uniqueness in lasso solutions? In light of the aforementioned result, this case really only arises when some of the predictor variables are discrete, or when some post-processing has been performed on continuous predictor measurements. Though we certainly cannot claim to provide a complete answer to such a broad question, we do present progress towards understanding some aspects of non-uniqueness. First, we extend the LARS algorithm for computing the lasso solution path to cover the non-unique case, so that this path algorithm works for any predictor matrix. Next, we derive a simple method for computing the component-wise uncertainty in lasso solutions of any given problem instance, based on linear programming. Finally, we review results from the literature on some of the unifying properties of lasso solutions, and also point out particular forms of solutions that have distinctive properties.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing is a signal acquisition framework based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for stable recovery. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressive sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. Our theoretical contribution is to characterize the fundamental performance limits of DCS recovery for jointly sparse signal ensembles in the noiseless measurement setting; our result connects single-signal, joint, and distributed (multi-encoder) compressive sensing. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and to show that additional challenges such as computational tractability can be addressed, we study in detail three example models for jointly sparse signals. For these models, we develop practical algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections. In two of our three models, the results are asymptotically best-possible, meaning that both the upper and lower bounds match the performance of our practical algorithms. Moreover, simulations indicate that the asymptotics take effect with just a moderate number of signals. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor arrays and networks.},

We next explore the online setting, showing that there exist adversaries that force any online scheduling policy to miss due dates. This impossibility result motivates the problem of minimizing the maximum interval stretch of any job; the interval stretch of a job is the job's flow time divided by the job's due date minus release time. We show that several common scheduling strategies, including the "hit-the-highest-nail" strategy beloved by procrastinators, have arbitrarily large maximum interval stretch. Then we give the "thrashing" scheduling policy and show that it is a $\backslash$Theta(1) approximation algorithm for the maximum interval stretch.},

We analyze the exact and asymptotic counts of vertices by rank, the distance from the set of leaves. The asymptotic fraction \$c\_k\$ of vertices of a fixed rank \$k\backslash ge 0\$ is shown to decay exponentially with \$k\$. Notoriously hard to compute, the exact fractions \$c\_k\$ had been determined for \$k\backslash le 3\$ only. We computed \$c\_4\$ and \$c\_5\$ as well; both are ratios of enormous integers, denominator of \$c\_5\$ being \$274\$ digits long. Prompted by the data, we proved that, in sharp contrast, the largest prime divisor of \$c\_k\$'s denominator is \$2\^{}\{k+1\}+1\$ at most. We conjecture that, in fact, the prime divisors of every denominator for \$k>1\$ form a single interval, from \$2\$ to the largest prime not exceeding \$2\^{}\{k+1\}+1\$.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide, TiO\$\_2\$, is a refractory species that could play a crucial role in the dust-condensation sequence around oxygen-rich evolved stars. To date, gas phase TiO\$\_2\$ has been detected only in the complex environment of the red supergiant VY CMa. We aim to constrain the distribution and excitation of TiO\$\_2\$ around VY CMa in order to clarify its role in dust formation. We analyse spectra and channel maps for TiO\$\_2\$ extracted from ALMA science verification data. We detect 15 transitions of TiO\$\_2\$, and spatially resolve the emission for the first time. The maps demonstrate a highly clumpy, anisotropic outflow in which the TiO\$\_2\$ emission likely traces gas exposed to the stellar radiation field. A roughly east-west oriented, accelerating bipolar-like structure is found, of which the blue component runs into and breaks up around a solid continuum component. A distinct tail to the south-west is seen for some transitions, consistent with features seen in the optical and near-infrared. We find that a significant fraction of TiO\$\_2\$ remains in the gas phase outside the dust-formation zone and suggest that this species might play only a minor role in the dust-condensation process around extreme oxygen-rich evolved stars like VY CMa.},

We present a thorough comparison of experimental data with predictions based on a virial approximation and simulation results. We find that the virial approach describes the experimental data reasonably well up to a volume fraction of \$\backslash phi=0.25\$ which provides us with a fast and non-costly tool for the analysis and prediction of Evanescent Wave DLS data. Based on this we propose a new method to assess the near-wall self-diffusion at elevated density. Here, we qualitatively confirm earlier results [Michailidou et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2009, 102, 068302], which indicate that many-particle hydrodynamic interactions are diminished by the presence of the wall at increasing volume fractions as compared to bulk dynamics. Beyond this finding we show that this diminishment is different for the particle motion normal and parallel to the wall.},

abstract = {We consider a convex relaxation of sparse principal component analysis proposed by d'Aspremont et al. in (d'Aspremont et al. SIAM Rev 49:434-448, 2007). This convex relaxation is a nonsmooth semidefinite programming problem in which the \$\backslash ell\_1\$ norm of the desired matrix is imposed in either the objective function or the constraint to improve the sparsity of the resulting matrix. The sparse principal component is obtained by a rank-one decomposition of the resulting sparse matrix. We propose an alternating direction method based on a variable-splitting technique and an augmented Lagrangian framework for solving this nonsmooth semidefinite programming problem. In contrast to the first-order method proposed in (d'Aspremont et al. SIAM Rev 49:434-448, 2007) that solves approximately the dual problem of the original semidefinite programming problem, our method deals with the primal problem directly and solves it exactly, which guarantees that the resulting matrix is a sparse matrix. Global convergence result is established for the proposed method. Numerical results on both synthetic problems and the real applications from classification of text data and senate voting data are reported to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

abstract = {This paper presents a tutorial for CS applications in communications networks. The Shannon's sampling theorem states that to recover a signal, the sampling rate must be as least the Nyquist rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is based on the surprising fact that to recover a signal that is sparse in certain representations, one can sample at the rate far below the Nyquist rate. Since its inception in 2006, CS attracted much interest in the research community and found wide-ranging applications from astronomy, biology, communications, image and video processing, medicine, to radar. CS also found successful applications in communications networks. CS was applied in the detection and estimation of wireless signals, source coding, multi-access channels, data collection in sensor networks, and network monitoring, etc. In many cases, CS was shown to bring performance gains on the order of 10X. We believe this is just the beginning of CS applications in communications networks, and the future will see even more fruitful applications of CS in our field.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the importance of boundary effects on the overall connection probability of wireless networks, but has largely focused on convex domains. We consider two generic scenarios of practical importance to wireless communications, in which one or more nodes are located outside the convex space where the remaining nodes reside. Consequently, conventional approaches with the underlying assumption that only line-of-sight (LOS) or direct connections between nodes are possible, fail to provide the correct analysis for the connectivity. We present an analytical framework that explicitly considers the effects of reflections from the system boundaries on the full connection probability. This study provides a different strategy to ray tracing tools for predicting the wireless propagation environment. A simple two-dimensional geometry is first considered, followed by a more practical three-dimensional system. We investigate the effects of different system parameters on the connectivity of the network though analysis corroborated by numerical simulations, and highlight the potential of our approach for more general non-convex geometries.t system parameters on the connectivity of the network through simulation and analysis.},

abstract = {Recent observational evidence suggests that the coarse angular resolution (\$\backslash sim20"\$ FWHM) of single-dish telescopes at sub-mm wavelengths has biased the observed galaxy number counts by blending together the sub-mm emission from multiple sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). We use lightcones computed from an updated implementation of the $\backslash$galform semi-analytic model to generate \$50\$ mock sub-mm surveys of \$0.5\$ deg\$\^{}2\$ at \$850\$ \$\backslash mu\$m, taking into account the effects of the finite single-dish beam in a more accurate way than has been done previously. We find that blending of SMGs does lead to an enhancement of source extracted number counts at bright fluxes (\$S\_\{\backslash mathrm\{850\}\backslash mu\backslash mathrm\{m\}\}\backslash gtrsim1\$ mJy). Typically, \$\backslash sim3\{-\}6\$ galaxies contribute \$90\backslash\%\$ of the flux of an \$S\_\{850\backslash mu\backslash mathrm\{m\}\}=5\$ mJy source and these blended galaxies are physically unassociated. We find that field-to-field variations are comparable to Poisson fluctuations for our \$S\_\{850\backslash mu\backslash mathrm\{m\}\}>5\$ mJy SMG population, which has a median redshift \$z\_\{50\}=2.0\$, but are greater than Poisson for the \$S\_\{850\backslash mu\backslash mathrm\{m\}\}>1\$ mJy population (\$z\_\{50\}=2.8\$). In a detailed comparison to a recent interferometric survey targeted at single-dish detected sources, we reproduce the difference between single-dish and interferometer number counts and find a median redshift (\$z\_\{50\}=2.5\$) in excellent agreement with the observed value (\$z\_\{50\}=2.5\backslash pm 0.2\$). We also present predictions for single-dish survey number counts at \$450\$ and \$1100\$ \$\backslash mu\$m, which show good agreement with observational data.},

abstract = {Scientists often express their understanding of the world through a computationally demanding simulation program. Analyzing the posterior distribution of the parameters given observations (the inverse problem) can be extremely challenging. The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework is the standard statistical tool to handle these likelihood free problems, but they require a very large number of simulations. In this work we develop two new ABC sampling algorithms that significantly reduce the number of simulations necessary for posterior inference. Both algorithms use confidence estimates for the accept probability in the Metropolis Hastings step to adaptively choose the number of necessary simulations. Our GPS-ABC algorithm stores the information obtained from every simulation in a Gaussian process which acts as a surrogate function for the simulated statistics. Experiments on a challenging realistic biological problem illustrate the potential of these algorithms.},

@article{Almog2015,
abstract = {The bilateral trade relations between world countries form a complex network, the International Trade Network (ITN), which is involved in an increasing number of worldwide economic processes, including globalization, integration, industrial production, and the propagation of shocks and instabilities. Characterizing the ITN via a simple yet accurate model is an open problem. The classical Gravity Model of trade successfully reproduces the volume of trade between two connected countries using known macroeconomic properties such as GDP and geographic distance. However, it generates a network with an unrealistically homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly heterogeneous structure of the real ITN. On the other hand, network models successfully reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but provide no information about trade volumes. Therefore macroeconomic and network models of trade suffer from complementary limitations but are still largely incompatible. Here, we make an important step forward in reconciling the two approaches, via the introduction of what we denote as the Enhanced Gravity Model (EGM) of trade. The EGM combines the maximum-entropy nature of network models with the established econometric structure of the Gravity Model. Using a single, unified and principled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to other economic networks, the EGM allows trade probabilities and trade volumes to be separately controlled via any combination of dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. We show that the EGM successfully reproduces both the topology and the weights of the ITN, finally reconciling the conflicting approaches. Moreover, it provides a general and simple theoretical explanation for the failure of economic models that do not explicitly focus on network topology: namely, their lack of topological invariance under a change of units.},

abstract = {The noisiness of a channel can be measured by comparing suitable functionals of the input and output distributions. For instance, the worst-case ratio of output relative entropy to input relative entropy for all possible pairs of input distributions is bounded from above by unity, by the data processing theorem. However, for a fixed reference input distribution, this quantity may be strictly smaller than one, giving so-called strong data processing inequalities (SDPIs). The same considerations apply to an arbitrary \$\backslash Phi\$-divergence. This paper presents a systematic study of optimal constants in SDPIs for discrete channels, including their variational characterizations, upper and lower bounds, structural results for channels on product probability spaces, and the relationship between SDPIs and so-called \$\backslash Phi\$-Sobolev inequalities (another class of inequalities that can be used to quantify the noisiness of a channel by controlling entropy-like functionals of the input distribution by suitable measures of input-output correlation). Several applications to information theory, discrete probability, and statistical physics are discussed.},

@article{Narasimhan2013a,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a MIMO receiver algorithm that exploits \{$\backslash$em channel hardening\} that occurs in large MIMO channels. Channel hardening refers to the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}H\{\backslash bf H\}\$ matrix become increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the channel gain matrix \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message passing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched filtered received vector (whose signal term becomes \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\{\backslash bf x\}\$, where \$\{\backslash bf x\}\$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation on the off-diagonal terms of the \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\$ matrix. We also propose a simple estimation scheme which directly obtains an estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\^{}T\{\backslash bf H\}\$ (instead of an estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$), which is used as an effective channel estimate in the MPD algorithm. We refer to this receiver as the \{$\backslash$em channel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP)\} receiver. The proposed CHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems (e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas). For the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD algorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection. This is because the MPD algorithm does not need a matrix inversion. It also achieves a significantly better performance compared to MMSE and other message passing detection algorithms using MMSE estimate of \$\{\backslash bf H\}\$. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed MPD algorithm. Further, we design optimized irregular low density parity check (LDPC) codes specific to the considered large MIMO channel and the CHEMP receiver through EXIT chart matching. The LDPC codes thus obtained achieve improved coded bit error rate performance compared to off-the-shelf irregular LDPC codes.},

abstract = {Variational methods in imaging are nowadays developing towards a quite universal and flexible tool, allowing for highly successful approaches on tasks like denoising, deblurring, inpainting, segmentation, super-resolution, disparity, and optical flow estimation. The overall structure of such approaches is of the form \$\{\backslash cal D\}(Ku) + \backslash alpha \{\backslash cal R\} (u) \backslash rightarrow \backslash min\_u\$ ; where the functional \$\{\backslash cal D\}\$ is a data fidelity term also depending on some input data \$f\$ and measuring the deviation of \$Ku\$ from such and \$\{\backslash cal R\}\$ is a regularization functional. Moreover \$K\$ is a (often linear) forward operator modeling the dependence of data on an underlying image, and \$\backslash alpha\$ is a positive regularization parameter. While \$\{\backslash cal D\}\$ is often smooth and (strictly) convex, the current practice almost exclusively uses nonsmooth regularization functionals. The majority of successful techniques is using nonsmooth and convex functionals like the total variation and generalizations thereof or \$\backslash ell\_1\$-norms of coefficients arising from scalar products with some frame system. The efficient solution of such variational problems in imaging demands for appropriate algorithms. Taking into account the specific structure as a sum of two very different terms to be minimized, splitting algorithms are a quite canonical choice. Consequently this field has revived the interest in techniques like operator splittings or augmented Lagrangians. Here we shall provide an overview of methods currently developed and recent results as well as some computational studies providing a comparison of different methods and also illustrating their success in applications.},

A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity-the number of nonzero coefficients-and practical sparsity-the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort.

Here we show that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes, also densely generates the set of unitary transformations (or orthogonal transformations, in the real case) on the single-photon subspace with m>=3 modes. (We prove the same result for any two-mode real optical gate, and for any two-mode optical gate combined with a generic phaseshifter.) Experimentally, this means that one does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality: any nontrivial beamsplitter is universal for linear optics. Theoretically, it means that one cannot produce "intermediate" models of linear optical computation (analogous to the Clifford group for qubits) by restricting the allowed beamsplitters and phaseshifters: there is a dichotomy; one either gets a trivial set or else a universal set. No similar classification theorem for gates acting on qubits is currently known. We leave open the problem of classifying optical gates that act on three or more modes.},

Here we study GT in the probabilistic setting focusing on the regime of small defective probability and large number of objects, \$p \backslash to 0\$ and \$N \backslash to \backslash infty\$. We construct and analyze one-stage algorithms for which we establish the occurrence of a non-detection/detection phase transition resulting in a sharp threshold, \$\backslash bar M\$, for the number of tests. By optimizing the pool design we construct algorithms whose detection threshold follows the optimal scaling \$\backslash bar M\backslash propto Np|\backslash log p|\$. Then we consider two-stages algorithms and analyze their performance for different choices of the first stage pools. In particular, via a proper random choice of the pools, we construct algorithms which attain the optimal value (previously determined in Ref.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched from inception to January 2012, with a limited update search in July 2012. Subject-specific websites, reference lists and professional health-care and commercial organisations were also consulted.

REVIEW METHODS: Six systematic reviews were conducted to consider the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and qualitative evidence on interventions for treating obesity in men, and men in contrast to women, and the effectiveness of interventions to engage men in their weight reduction. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up data of at least 1 year, or any study design and length of follow-up for UK studies, were included. Qualitative and mixed-method studies linked to RCTs and non-randomised intervention studies, and UK-based, men-only qualitative studies not linked to interventions were included. One reviewer extracted data from the included studies and a second reviewer checked data for omissions or inaccuracies. Two reviewers carried out quality assessment. We undertook meta-analysis of quantitative data and a realist approach to integrating the qualitative and quantitative evidence synthesis.

RESULTS: From a total of 12,764 titles reviewed, 33 RCTs with 12 linked reports, 24 non-randomised reports, five economic evaluations with two linked reports, and 22 qualitative studies were included. Men were more likely than women to benefit if physical activity was part of a weight-loss programme. Reducing diets tended to produce more favourable weight loss than physical activity alone (mean weight change after 1 year from a reducing diet compared with an exercise programme -3.2 kg, 95\% CI -4.8 kg to -1.6 kg). The type of reducing diet did not affect long-term weight loss. A reducing diet plus physical activity and behaviour change gave the most effective results. Low-fat reducing diets, some with meal replacements, combined with physical activity and behaviour change training gave the most effective long-term weight change in men [-5.2 kg (standard error 0.2 kg) after 4 years]. Such trials may prevent type 2 diabetes in men and improve erectile dysfunction. Although fewer men joined weight-loss programmes, once recruited they were less likely to drop out than women (difference 11\%, 95\% CI 8\% to 14\%). The perception of having a health problem (e.g. being defined as obese by a health professional), the impact of weight loss on health problems and desire to improve personal appearance without looking too thin were motivators for weight loss amongst men. The key components differ from those found for women, with men preferring more factual information on how to lose weight and more emphasis on physical activity programmes. Interventions delivered in social settings were preferred to those delivered in health-care settings. Group-based programmes showed benefits by facilitating support for men with similar health problems, and some individual tailoring of advice assisted weight loss in some studies. Generally, men preferred interventions that were individualised, fact-based and flexible, which used business-like language and which included simple to understand information. Preferences for men-only versus mixed-sex weight-loss group programmes were divided. In terms of context, programmes which were cited in a sporting context where participants have a strong sense of affiliation showed low drop out rates and high satisfaction. Although some men preferred weight-loss programmes delivered in an NHS context, the evidence comparing NHS and commercial programmes for men was unclear. The effect of family and friends on participants in weight-loss programmes was inconsistent in the evidence reviewed - benefits were shown in some cases, but the social role of food in maintaining relationships may also act as a barrier to weight loss. Evidence on the economics of managing obesity in men was limited and heterogeneous.

LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were the limited quantity and quality of the evidence base and narrow outcome reporting, particularly for men from disadvantaged and minority groups. Few of the studies were undertaken in the UK.

CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction for men is best achieved and maintained with the combination of a reducing diet, physical activity advice or a physical activity programme, and behaviour change techniques. Tailoring interventions and settings for men may enhance effectiveness, though further research is needed to better understand the influence of context and content. Future studies should include cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK setting.

These new cases are linked to the particular hypothesis on the maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra by which we localize the space of automorphic forms modulo \$l\$ of the unitary group. The strategy consist to go through the same property of genericness of subspace of the localized cohomolgoy of some Kottwitz-Harris-Taylor Shimura variety, by proving some sort of level lowering property. The proof relies on the freeness of the localized cohomology of these Shimura variety as it is proved in 1503.03303 and the description of the lattices in the Harris-Taylor perverse sheaves in the vanishing cycle perverse sheaf of these varieties, cf. 1309.5791 and 1309.1946.},

abstract = {We investigate the propagation of microwave photons in a one-dimensional open waveguide interacting with a number of artificial atoms (qubits). Within the formalism of projection operators and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach we develop a one-photon approximation scheme for the calculation of the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal in a waveguide which contains an arbitrary number $\backslash$emph\{N\} of non-interacting qubits. We considered in detail the resonances and photon mediated entanglement for two and three qubits in a chain. We showed that in non Markovian case the resonance widths, which define the decay rates of the entangled state, can be much smaller than the decay width of individual qubit. It is also shown that for identical qubits in the long wavelength limit a coherent superradiant state is formed with the width being equal to the sum of the widths of spontaneous transitions of $\backslash$emph\{N\} individual qubits. The results obtained in the paper are of general nature and can be applied to any type of qubits. The specific properties of the qubit are only encoded in the two parameters: the qubit energy \$\backslash Omega\$ and the rate of spontaneous emission \$\backslash Gamma\$.},

@article{Krahmer2012,
abstract = {In many signal processing applications, one wishes to acquire images that are sparse in transform domains such as spatial finite differences or wavelets using frequency domain samples. For such applications, overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that superior image reconstruction can be obtained through variable density sampling strategies that concentrate on lower frequencies. The wavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order wavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing theory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction guarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the so-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how correlated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar wavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly, so for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square power-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with near-optimal embedding dimensions. Consequently, the variable-density sampling strategy we provide allows for image reconstructions that are stable to sparsity defects and robust to measurement noise. Our results cover both reconstruction by \$\backslash ell\_1\$-minimization and by total variation minimization. The local coherence framework developed in this paper should be of independent interest in sparse recovery problems more generally, as it implies that for optimal sparse recovery results, it suffices to have bounded $\backslash$emph\{average\} coherence from sensing basis to sparsity basis -- as opposed to bounded maximal coherence -- as long as the sampling strategy is adapted accordingly.},

To date, a family of subgradient algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem under general convexity assumptions. This paper shows that, for the scalar case and by assuming a bit more, novel non-gradient-based algorithms with appealing features can be constructed. Specifically, we develop Pairwise Equalizing (PE) and Pairwise Bisectioning (PB), two gossip algorithms that solve unconstrained, separable, convex consensus optimization problems over undirected networks with time-varying topologies, where each local function is strictly convex, continuously differentiable, and has a minimizer. We show that PE and PB are easy to implement, bypass limitations of the subgradient algorithms, and produce switched, nonlinear, networked dynamical systems that admit a common Lyapunov function and asymptotically converge. Moreover, PE generalizes the well-known Pairwise Averaging and Randomized Gossip Algorithm, while PB relaxes a requirement of PE, allowing nodes to never share their local functions.},

abstract = {We propose a general framework for analyzing the performance of the MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimator) in estimating functionals of discrete distributions, under the worst-case mean squared error criterion. We show that existing theory, which was developed to accommodate a fixed alphabet and a growing number of observations, is insufficient for analyzing the bias of the MLE, and apply the theory of approximation using positive linear operators to study this bias. The variance is controlled using the well-known tools from the literature on concentration inequalities. Our techniques yield a characterization of the worst-case \$L\_2\$ risk incurred by the MLE in estimating the Shannon entropy \$H(P) = \backslash sum\_\{i = 1\}\^{}S -p\_i \backslash ln p\_i\$, and \$F\_\backslash alpha(P) = \backslash sum\_\{i = 1\}\^{}S p\_i\^{}\backslash alpha,\backslash alpha>0\$ up to a multiplicative constant, for any alphabet size \$S\backslash leq \backslash infty\$ and sample size \$n\$. We show that it is necessary and sufficient to have \$n \backslash gg S\$ observations for the MLE to be consistent in Shannon entropy estimation. The MLE requires \$n \backslash gg S\^{}\{1/\backslash alpha\}\$ samples to consistently estimate \$F\_\backslash alpha(P), 0<\backslash alpha<1\$. The minimax rate-optimal estimators for both problems require \$S/\backslash ln S\$ and \$S\^{}\{1/\backslash alpha\}/\backslash ln S\$ samples, which implies that the MLE has a strictly sub-optimal sample complexity. When \$1<\backslash alpha<3/2\$, we show that the worst-case \$L\_2\$ rate of convergence for the MLE is \$n\^{}\{-2(\backslash alpha-1)\}\$ for infinite alphabet size, while the minimax \$L\_2\$ rate is \$(n\backslash ln n)\^{}\{-2(\backslash alpha-1)\}\$. When \$\backslash alpha\backslash geq 3/2\$, the MLE achieves the optimal \$L\_2\$ convergence rate \$n\^{}\{-1\}\$ regardless of the alphabet size. We explicitly establish an equivalence between bias analysis of plug-in estimators for general functionals under arbitrary statistical models, and the theory of approximation using positive linear operators. This equivalence is of relevance and consequence far beyond the specific problem setting in this paper.},

As expected for the early period much of the gamma-ray signal is confined to energies below \$\backslash sim\$200 keV, while for the late period it is most strong above 400 keV. In particular, in the late period \$\^{}\{56\}\$Co lines at 847 and 1248 keV are detected at 4.7 and 4.3 \$\backslash sigma\$ respectively. The lightcurves in several representative energy bands are calculated for the entire period. The resulting spectra and lightcurves are compared with a subset of models. We confirm our previous finding that the gamma-ray data are broadly consistent with the expectations for canonical 1D models, such as delayed detonation or deflagration models for a near-Chandrasekhar mass WD. Late optical spectra (day 136 after the explosion) show rather symmetric Co and Fe lines profiles, suggesting that unless the viewing angle is special, the distribution of radioactive elements is symmetric in the ejecta.},

abstract = {A strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum channel states that the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero in the limit of many channel uses if the rate of communication exceeds the classical capacity of the channel. Along with a corresponding achievability statement for rates below the capacity, such a strong converse theorem enhances our understanding of the capacity as a very sharp dividing line between achievable and unachievable rates of communication. Here, we show that such a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of all entanglement-breaking channels and all Hadamard channels (the complementary channels of the former). These results follow by bounding the success probability in terms of a "sandwiched" Renyi relative entropy, by showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking and Hadamard channels, and by relating this quantity to the Holevo capacity. Prior results regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant channels emerge as a special case of our results.},

We present continuously sampled data at 640-ns time resolution, and individual bright pulses recorded at down to 0.25-ns time resolution. Combining our new data with previous data from our group and from the literature shows the dramatic changes in the pulsar's radio emission between low and high radio frequencies. Below about 5 GHz the mean profile is dominated by the bright Main Pulse and Low-Frequency Interpulse. Everything changes, however, above about 5 GHz; the Main Pulse disappears, the mean profile of the Crab pulsar is dominated by the High-Frequency Interpulse (which is quite different from its low-frequency counterpart) and the two High-Frequency Components. We present detailed observational characteristics of these different components which future models of the pulsar's magnetosphere must explain.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the manner in which classical universes are obtained in the no-boundary quantum state. In this context, universes can be characterised as classical (in a WKB sense) when the wavefunction is highly oscillatory, i.e. when the ratio of the change in the amplitude of the wavefunction becomes small compared to the change in the phase. In the presence of a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied in proportion to a factor \$e\^{}\{-(\backslash epsilon - 3)N/(\backslash epsilon -1)\},\$ where \$\backslash epsilon\$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and \$N\$ designates the number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in \$N\$, but only when \$\backslash epsilon < 1\$ (inflation) or \$\backslash epsilon > 3\$ (ekpyrosis). Furthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over into a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to that point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential, where a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form \$-\backslash phi\^{}n\$ (with \$n=4,6,8\$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly kinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then quickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis, which are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share the perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time classical in the first place.},

abstract = {The success of a security attack crucially depends on time: the more time available to the attacker, the higher the probability of a successful attack. Formalisms such as Reliability block diagrams, Reliability graphs and Attack Countermeasure trees provide quantitative information about attack scenarios, but they are provably insufficient to model dependent actions which involve costs, skills, and time. In this presentation, we extend the Attack Countermeasure trees with a notion of time; inspired by the fact that there is a strong correlation between the amount of resources in which the attacker invests (in this case time) and probability that an attacker succeeds. This allows for an effective selection of countermeasures and rank them according to their resource consumption in terms of costs/skills of installing them and effectiveness in preventing an attack},

abstract = {We study the problem of recovering the phase from magnitude measurements; specifically, we wish to reconstruct a complex-valued signal x of C\^{}n about which we have phaseless samples of the form y\_r = |< a\_r,x >|\^{}2, r = 1,2,...,m (knowledge of the phase of these samples would yield a linear system). This paper develops a non-convex formulation of the phase retrieval problem as well as a concrete solution algorithm. In a nutshell, this algorithm starts with a careful initialization obtained by means of a spectral method, and then refines this initial estimate by iteratively applying novel update rules, which have low computational complexity, much like in a gradient descent scheme. The main contribution is that this algorithm is shown to rigorously allow the exact retrieval of phase information from a nearly minimal number of random measurements. Indeed, the sequence of successive iterates provably converges to the solution at a geometric rate so that the proposed scheme is efficient both in terms of computational and data resources. In theory, a variation on this scheme leads to a near-linear time algorithm for a physically realizable model based on coded diffraction patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods with various experiments on image data. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of non-convex optimization schemes that may have implications for computational problems beyond phase retrieval.},

abstract = {Nonconvex and structured optimization problems arise in many engineering applications that demand scalable and distributed solution methods. The study of the convergence properties of these methods is in general difficult due to the nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributed solution methods that combine the fast convergence properties of augmented Lagrangian-based methods with the separability properties of alternating optimization are investigated. The first method is adapted from the classic quadratic penalty function method and is called the Alternating Direction Penalty Method (ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method, in which single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating optimization, which in turn makes it scalable. The second method is the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that ADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible point under mild conditions and an additional condition ensuring that it asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local optimality are introduced. In the case of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under which the algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions are established. Based on this, complete convergence of ADMM for a class of low dimensional problems are characterized. Finally, the results are illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization problem in wireless sensor networks.},

abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to introduce a version of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs to solve problems in measure concentration. We specifically target systems of dependent random variables, since that is where the power of Stein's method is fully realized. Because the theory is quite abstract, we have tried to put in as many examples as possible. Some of the highlighted applications are as follows: (a) We shall find an easily verifiable condition under which a popular heuristic technique originating from physics, known as the "mean field equations" method, is valid. No such condition is currently known. (b) We shall present a way of using couplings to derive concentration inequalities. Although couplings are routinely used for proving decay of correlations, no method for using couplings to derive concentration bounds is available in the literature. This will be used to obtain (c) concentration inequalities with explicit constants under Dobrushin's condition of weak dependence. (d) We shall give a method for obtaining concentration of Haar measures using convergence rates of related random walks on groups. Using this technique and one of the numerous available results about rates of convergence of random walks, we will then prove (e) a quantitative version of Voiculescu's celebrated connection between random matrix theory and free probability.},

abstract = {Compressed Sensing suggests that the required number of samples for reconstructing a signal can be greatly reduced if it is sparse in a known discrete basis, yet many real-world signals are sparse in a continuous dictionary. One example is the spectrally-sparse signal, which is composed of a small number of spectral atoms with arbitrary frequencies on the unit interval. In this paper we study the problem of line spectrum denoising and estimation with an ensemble of spectrally-sparse signals composed of the same set of continuous-valued frequencies from their partial and noisy observations. Two approaches are developed based on atomic norm minimization and structured covariance estimation, both of which can be solved efficiently via semidefinite programming. The first approach aims to estimate and denoise the set of signals from their partial and noisy observations via atomic norm minimization, and recover the frequencies via examining the dual polynomial of the convex program. We characterize the optimality condition of the proposed algorithm and derive the expected convergence rate for denoising, demonstrating the benefit of including multiple measurement vectors. The second approach aims to recover the population covariance matrix from the partially observed sample covariance matrix by motivating its low-rank Toeplitz structure without recovering the signal ensemble. Performance guarantee is derived with a finite number of measurement vectors. The frequencies can be recovered via conventional spectrum estimation methods such as MUSIC from the estimated covariance matrix. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the favorable performance of the proposed algorithms, with comparisons against several existing approaches.},

abstract = {The noisiness of a channel can be measured by comparing suitable functionals of the input and output distributions. For instance, the worst-case ratio of output relative entropy to input relative entropy for all possible pairs of input distributions is bounded from above by unity, by the data processing theorem. However, for a fixed reference input distribution, this quantity may be strictly smaller than one, giving so-called strong data processing inequalities (SDPIs). The same considerations apply to an arbitrary \$\backslash Phi\$-divergence. This paper presents a systematic study of optimal constants in SDPIs for discrete channels, including their variational characterizations, upper and lower bounds, structural results for channels on product probability spaces, and the relationship between SDPIs and so-called \$\backslash Phi\$-Sobolev inequalities (another class of inequalities that can be used to quantify the noisiness of a channel by controlling entropy-like functionals of the input distribution by suitable measures of input-output correlation). Several applications to information theory, discrete probability, and statistical physics are discussed.},

Moreover, for symbol-wise functions, the necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence is established. Our result for the full side-information case is a generalization of the result by Ahlswede and Csiszar to sources with memory; our dichotomy theorem is different from Han and Kobayashi's dichotomy theorem, which reveals an effect of memory in distributed function computation. All results are given not only for fixed-length coding but also for variable-length coding in a unified manner.

Let \$X\^{}T = \backslash\{X\_t,0\backslash leq t\backslash leq T\backslash\}\$ be governed by the probability law \$P\_\{\backslash theta\}\$ from a class of possible laws indexed by \$\backslash theta \backslash in \backslash Lambda\$, and \$Y\^{}T\$ be the noise corrupted observations of \$X\^{}T\$ available to the estimator. We characterize the estimator minimizing the worst case regret, where regret is the difference between the causal estimation loss of the estimator and that of the optimum estimator.   One of the main contributions of this paper is characterizing the minimax estimator, showing that it is in fact a Bayesian estimator. We then relate minimax regret to the channel capacity when the channel is either Gaussian or Poisson. In this case, we characterize the minimax regret and the minimax estimator more explicitly. If we further assume that the uncertainty set consists of deterministic signals, the worst case regret is exactly equal to the corresponding channel capacity, namely the maximal mutual information attainable across the channel among all possible distributions on the uncertainty set of signals. The corresponding minimax estimator is the Bayesian estimator assuming the capacity-achieving prior. Using this relation, we also show that the capacity achieving prior coincides with the least favorable input. Moreover, we show that this minimax estimator is not only minimizing the worst case regret but also essentially minimizing regret for "most" of the other sources in the uncertainty set.   We present a couple of examples for the construction of an minimax filter via an approximation of the associated capacity achieving distribution.},

abstract = {The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) nonoverlapping groups of features. The nonoverlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. Our methods and theoretical results are then generalized to tackle the general overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the l(q) norm. We further extend our algorithm to solve a nonconvex overlapping group Lasso formulation based on the capped norm regularization, which reduces the estimation bias introduced by the convex penalty. We have performed empirical evaluations using both a synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression dataset, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the nonconvex formulation for overlapping group Lasso.},

In this paper, the improved PCGS algorithm is verified as a coordinative to the left-preconditioned system; this is done by comparing, analyzing, and executing numerical examinations of various PCGS algorithms, including the most recently proposed one. We show that the direction of the preconditioned system for the CGS method is determined by the operations of \$\backslash alpha\_k\$ and \$\backslash beta\_k\$ in the PCGS algorithm.

We introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme with information-theoretic code aggregation, showing for the first time how random forest, a technique that together with deep learning have shown spectacular results in classification, can also be extended to large-scale retrieval. Traditional random forest fails to enforce the consistency of hashes generated from each tree for the same class data, i.e., to preserve the underlying similarity, and it also lacks a principled way for code aggregation across trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme, where independently trained random trees in a forest are acting as hashing functions. We the propose a subspace model as the splitting function, and show that it enforces the hash consistency in a tree for data from the same class. We also introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. Experiments on large-scale public datasets are presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for retrieval tasks.},

abstract = {We consider distributed optimization in random networks where N nodes cooperatively minimize the sum $\backslash$sum\_\{i=1\}\^{}N f\_i(x) of their individual convex costs. Existing literature proposes distributed gradient-like methods that are computationally cheap and resilient to link failures, but have slow convergence rates. In this paper, we propose accelerated distributed gradient methods that: 1) are resilient to link failures; 2) computationally cheap; and 3) improve convergence rates over other gradient methods. We model the network by a sequence of independent, identically distributed random matrices \{W(k)\} drawn from the set of symmetric, stochastic matrices with positive diagonals. The network is connected on average and the cost functions are convex, differentiable, with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients. We design two distributed Nesterov-like gradient methods that modify the D-NG and D-NC methods that we proposed for static networks. We prove their convergence rates in terms of the expected optimality gap at the cost function. Let k and K be the number of per-node gradient evaluations and per-node communications, respectively. Then the modified D-NG achieves rates O(log k/k) and O($\backslash$log K/K), and the modified D-NC rates O(1/k\^{}2) and O(1/K\^{}\{2-$\backslash$xi\}), where $\backslash$xi>0 is arbitrarily small. For comparison, the standard distributed gradient method cannot do better than $\backslash$Omega(1/k\^{}\{2/3\}) and $\backslash$Omega(1/K\^{}\{2/3\}), on the same class of cost functions (even for static networks). Simulation examples illustrate our analytical findings.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing aims to undersample certain high-dimensional signals, yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics. Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization -- which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization.   We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true sparsity-undersampling tradeoff. There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based on random convex polytopes and this new, apparently very different theoretical formalism.},

abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society, much quoted examples including the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, or the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing principles. Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

abstract = {As structured documents with rich metadata (such as products, movies, etc.) become increasingly prevalent, searching those documents has become an important IR problem. Although advanced search interfaces are widely available, most users still prefer to use keyword-based queries to search those documents. Query keywords often imply some hidden restrictions on the desired documents, which can be represented as document facet-value pairs. To achieve high retrieval performance, it's important to be able to identify the relevant facet-value pairs hidden in a query. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying document facet-value pairs that are relevant to a keyword-based search query. We propose a machine learning approach and a set of useful features, and evaluate our approach using a movie data set from INEX.},

abstract = {We study distributed optimization in networked systems, where nodes cooperate to find the optimal quantity of common interest, x=x\^{}$\backslash$star. The objective function of the corresponding optimization problem is the sum of private (known only by a node,) convex, nodes' objectives and each node imposes a private convex constraint on the allowed values of x. We solve this problem for generic connected network topologies with asymmetric random link failures with a novel distributed, decentralized algorithm. We refer to this algorithm as AL-G (augmented Lagrangian gossiping,) and to its variants as AL-MG (augmented Lagrangian multi neighbor gossiping) and AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian broadcast gossiping.) The AL-G algorithm is based on the augmented Lagrangian dual function. Dual variables are updated by the standard method of multipliers, at a slow time scale. To update the primal variables, we propose a novel, Gauss-Seidel type, randomized algorithm, at a fast time scale. AL-G uses unidirectional gossip communication, only between immediate neighbors in the network and is resilient to random link failures. For networks with reliable communication (i.e., no failures,) the simplified, AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian broadcast gossiping) algorithm reduces communication, computation and data storage cost. We prove convergence for all proposed algorithms and demonstrate by simulations the effectiveness on two applications: l\_1-regularized logistic regression for classification and cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks.},

abstract = {We study the feasibility of cognitive radio (CR) communication in the presence of a \$K\$-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) interference channel as the primary network. Assuming that the primary interference network has unused spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), we first investigate the sufficient condition on the number of antennas at the secondary transmitter under which the secondary system can communicate while causing no interference to the primary receivers. We show that, to maximize the benefit, the secondary transmitter should have at least the same number of antennas as the spatial DoFs of the primary system. We then derive the secondary precoding and decoding matrices to have zero interference leakage into the primary network while the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver is maximized. As the success of the secondary communication depends on the availability of unused DoFs, we then propose a fast sensing method based on the eigenvalue analysis of the received signal covariance matrix to determine the availability of unused DoFs or equivalently spatial holes. Since the proposed fast sensing method cannot identify the indices of inactive primary streams, we also provide a fine sensing method based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to decide the absence of individual primary streams. Simulation results show that the proposed CR sensing and transmission scheme can, in practice, provide a significant throughput while causing no interference to the primary receivers, and that the sensing detects the spatial holes of the primary network with high detection probability.},

We show that a sequence of \$q\$ LCE queries for a string of size \$n\$ over a general ordered alphabet can be realized in \$O(q \backslash log \backslash log n+n\backslash log\^{}*n)\$ time making only \$O(q+n)\$ symbol comparisons. Consequently, all runs in a string over a general ordered alphabet can be computed in \$O(n \backslash log \backslash log n)\$ time making \$O(n)\$ symbol comparisons. Our results improve upon a solution by Kosolobov (Information Processing Letters, 2016), who gave an algorithm with \$O(n \backslash log\^{}\{2/3\} n)\$ running time and conjectured that \$O(n)\$ time is possible. We make a significant progress towards resolving this conjecture. Our techniques extend to the case of general unordered alphabets, when the time increases to \$O(q\backslash log n + n\backslash log\^{}*n)\$.

In particular we are interested in the typical times \$t\$ for which all the eigenvalues are simultaneously close to \$1\$ in different ways thus corresponding to recurrence times in the issue of quantum measurements. Our strategy consists in rewriting the problem as a random matrix integral and use loop equations techniques to compute the first orders of the large \$N\$ asymptotic. We also connect the problem to the computation of a large Toeplitz determinant whose symbol is the characteristic function of several arc segments of the unit circle. In particular in the case of a single arc segment we recover Widom's formula. Eventually we explain why the first return time is expected to converge towards an exponential distribution when \$N\$ is large. Numeric simulations are provided along the paper to illustrate the results.},

The algorithm, AMP-MMV, is capable of exploiting temporal correlations in the amplitudes of non-zero coefficients, and provides soft estimates of the signal vectors as well as the underlying support. Central to the proposed approach is an extension of recently developed approximate message passing techniques to the amplitude-correlated MMV setting. Aided by these techniques, AMP-MMV offers a computational complexity that is linear in all problem dimensions. In order to allow for automatic parameter tuning, an expectation-maximization algorithm that complements AMP-MMV is described. Finally, a detailed numerical study demonstrates the power of the proposed approach and its particular suitability for application to high-dimensional problems.},

In addition to the algorithmic framework, we provide three contributions: (i) numerical results showing that state evolution holds for non-separable Bayesian sliding-window denoisers; (ii) a universal denoiser that does not require the input signal to be bounded; and (iii) we modify the GM learning algorithm, and extend it to an i.i.d. denoiser.

abstract = {Theoreticians have studied distributed algorithms in the radio network model for close to three decades. A significant fraction of this work focuses on lower bounds for basic communication problems such as wake-up (symmetry breaking among an unknown set of nodes) and broadcast (message dissemination through an unknown network topology). In this paper, we introduce a new technique for proving this type of bound, based on reduction from a probabilistic hitting game, that simplifies and strengthens much of this existing work. In more detail, in this single paper we prove new expected time and high probability lower bounds for wake-up and global broadcast in single and multichannel versions of the radio network model both with and without collision detection. In doing so, we are able to reproduce results that previously spanned a half-dozen papers published over a period of twenty-five years. In addition to simplifying these existing results, our technique, in many places, also improves the state of the art: of the eight bounds we prove, four strictly strengthen the best known previous result (in terms of time complexity and/or generality of the algorithm class for which it holds), and three provide the first known non-trivial bound for the case in question. The fact that the same technique can easily generate this diverse collection of lower bounds indicates a surprising unity underlying communication tasks in the radio network model---revealing that deep down, below the specifics of the problem definition and model assumptions, communication in this setting reduces to finding efficient strategies for a simple game.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient ADMM method with guarantees for high-dimensional problems. We provide explicit bounds for the sparse optimization problem and the noisy matrix decomposition problem. For sparse optimization, we establish that the modified ADMM method has an optimal convergence rate of \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}(s\backslash log d/T)\$, where \$s\$ is the sparsity level, \$d\$ is the data dimension and \$T\$ is the number of steps. This matches with the minimax lower bounds for sparse estimation. For matrix decomposition into sparse and low rank components, we provide the first guarantees for any online method, and prove a convergence rate of \$\backslash tilde\{\backslash mathcal\{O\}\}((s+r)\backslash beta\^{}2(p) /T) + \backslash mathcal\{O\}(1/p)\$ for a \$p\backslash times p\$ matrix, where \$s\$ is the sparsity level, \$r\$ is the rank and \$\backslash Theta(\backslash sqrt\{p\})\backslash leq \backslash beta(p)\backslash leq \backslash Theta(p)\$. Our guarantees match the minimax lower bound with respect to \$s,r\$ and \$T\$. In addition, we match the minimax lower bound with respect to the matrix dimension \$p\$, i.e. \$\backslash beta(p)=\backslash Theta(\backslash sqrt\{p\})\$, for many important statistical models including the independent noise model, the linear Bayesian network and the latent Gaussian graphical model under some conditions. Our ADMM method is based on epoch-based annealing and consists of inexpensive steps which involve projections on to simple norm balls. Experiments show that for both sparse optimization and matrix decomposition problems, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we reach higher accuracy with same time complexity.},

The electric field of the light can drive an effective magnetic field of order of ten Tesla. For lower frequency light, a non-equilibrium spin distribution is formed near the Fermi surface. Due to the spin-momentum locking, a giant electric current proportional to the effective magnetic field is induced. On the other hand, higher frequency light realizes a quasi-static Floquet state with no induced electric current. We discuss relevant materials and estimate order of magnitude of the induced current.},

abstract = {Researchers are often confused about what can be inferred from significance tests. One problem occurs when people apply Bayesian intuitions to significance testing-two approaches that must be firmly separated. This article presents some common situations in which the approaches come to different conclusions; you can see where your intuitions initially lie. The situations include multiple testing, deciding when to stop running participants, and when a theory was thought of relative to finding out results. The interpretation of nonsignificant results has also been persistently problematic in a way that Bayesian inference can clarify. The Bayesian and orthodox approaches are placed in the context of different notions of rationality, and I accuse myself and others as having been irrational in the way we have been using statistics on a key notion of rationality. The reader is shown how to apply Bayesian inference in practice, using free online software, to allow more coherent inferences from data.},

We start with the report of an event (such as 9/11 terroristic attack) represented as a series of individual strings of information denoted respectively by two-state variable Ei=+/-1, i=1,..., N. Assigning Ei value to all strings, the initial order parameter and entropy are determined. Conspiracy theorists comment on the report, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek and changing their meaning (from -1 to +1). The reading of the event is turned fuzzy with an increased entropy value. Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity to its maximum value, meaning N/2 variables with Ei=1, doubt prevails in the reading of the event and the chance is created that an alternative theory might prevail. Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measure the degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory. Our general framework relies on online content made voluntarily available by crowds of people, in response to some news or blog articles published by official news agencies. We apply different aggregation levels (comment, person, discussion thread) and discuss the associated patterns of entropy change.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamic behavior of the stationary random process defined by a central complex Wishart (CW) matrix \$\{\backslash bf\{W\}\}(t)\$ as it varies along a certain dimension \$t\$. We characterize the second-order joint cdf of the largest eigenvalue, and the second-order joint cdf of the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix. We show that both cdfs can be expressed in exact closed-form in terms of a finite number of well-known special functions in the context of communication theory. As a direct application, we investigate the dynamic behavior of the parallel channels associated with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the presence of Rayleigh fading. Studying the complex random matrix that defines the MIMO channel, we characterize the second-order joint cdf of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the best and worst channels. We use these results to study the rate of change of MIMO parallel channels, using different performance metrics. For a given value of the MIMO channel correlation coefficient, we observe how the SNR associated with the best parallel channel changes slower than the SNR of the worst channel. This different dynamic behavior is much more appreciable when the number of transmit (\$N\_T\$) and receive (\$N\_R\$) antennas is similar. However, as \$N\_T\$ is increased while keeping \$N\_R\$ fixed, we see how the best and worst channels tend to have a similar rate of change.},

In connection with the Theory of Renewal Processes we characterize all determinantal random point fields in R\^{}1 and Z\^{}1 with independent identically distributed spacings.

The proofs are based on a combination of the moment method and geometric functional analysis techniques. As an application, we show that our bounds immediately yield the correct phase transition behavior of the spectral edge of random band matrices and of sparse Wigner matrices.

For a centroiding algorithm, background light can lead to a systematic bias of the centroid positions towards the centre of the software window. We implement a matched filter algorithm for the estimation of the centroid positions of the Shack-Hartmann spots recorded by our aberrometer. We briefly present the performance of our algorithm, and recall the well-known robustness of the matched filter algorithm to background light. Using data collected on 5 human eyes, we parameterise a simple and fast centroiding algorithm and reduce the difference between the two algorithms down to a mean residual wavefront of 0.02 microm rms.},

abstract = {An oracle chooses a function \$f\$ from the set of \$n\$ bits strings to itself, which is either a randomly chosen permutation or a randomly chosen function. When queried by an \$n\$-bit string \$w\$, the oracle computes \$f(w)\$, truncates the \$m\$ last bits, and returns only the first \$n-m\$ bits of \$f(w)\$. How many queries does a querying adversary need to submit in order to distinguish the truncated permutation from a random function?   In 1998, Hall et al. showed an algorithm for determining (with high probability) whether or not \$f\$ is a permutation, using \$O(2\^{}\{\backslash frac\{m+n\}\{2\}\})\$ queries. They also showed that if \$m < n/7\$, a smaller number of queries will not suffice. For \$m > n/7\$, their method gives a weaker bound. In this manuscript, we show how a modification of the method used by Hall et al. can solve the porblem completely. It extends the result to essentially every \$m\$, showing that \$\backslash Omega(2\^{}\{\backslash frac\{m+n\}\{2\}\})\$ queries are needed to get a non-negligible distinguishing advantage. We recently became aware that a better bound for the distinguishing advantage, for every \$m<n\$, follows from a result of Stam published, in a different context, already in 1978.},

In this paper, we introduce a regularized MRW learning model, using a low-rank penalty to constrain the global subspace structure, for subspace clustering and estimation. In our framework, both the local pairwise similarity and the global subspace structure can be learnt from the transition probabilities of MRW. We prove that under some suitable conditions, our proposed local/global criteria can exactly capture the multiple subspace structure and learn a low-dimensional embedding for the data, in which giving the true segmentation of subspaces. To improve robustness in real situations, we also propose an extension of the MRW learning model based on integrating transition matrix learning and error correction in a unified framework. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real applications demonstrate that our proposed MRW learning model and its robust extension outperform the state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.},

abstract = {An open problem in polarization theory is to determine the binary operations that always lead to polarization when they are used in Ar\{$\backslash$i\}kan style constructions. This paper, which is presented in two parts, solves this problem by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a binary operation to be polarizing. This (second) part provides a foundation of polarization theory based on the ergodic theory of binary operations which we developed in the first part. We show that a binary operation is polarizing if and only if it is uniformity preserving and its inverse is strongly ergodic. The rate of polarization of single user channels is studied. It is shown that the exponent of any polarizing operation cannot exceed 1/2, which is the exponent of quasigroup operations. We also study the polarization of multiple access channels (MAC). In particular, we show that a sequence of binary operations is MAC-polarizing if and only if each binary operation in the sequence is polarizing. It is shown that the exponent of any MAC-polarizing sequence cannot exceed 1/2, which is the exponent of sequences of quasigroup operations.},

In this paper we demonstrate that the restricted isometry property (RIP) can be used for a very straightforward analysis of OMP. Our main conclusion is that the RIP of order \$K+1\$ (with isometry constant \$\backslash delta < \backslash frac\{1\}\{3\backslash sqrt\{K\}\}\$) is sufficient for OMP to exactly recover any \$K\$-sparse signal. Our analysis relies on simple and intuitive observations about OMP and matrices which satisfy the RIP. For restricted classes of \$K\$-sparse signals (those that are highly compressible), a relaxed bound on the isometry constant is also established. A deeper understanding of OMP may benefit the analysis of greedy algorithms in general. To demonstrate this, we also briefly revisit the analysis of the Regularized OMP (ROMP) algorithm.},

@article{Pereyra2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a new Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) that uses convex analysis to simulate efficiently from high-dimensional densities that are log-concave, a class of probability distributions that is widely used in modern high-dimensional statistics and data analysis. The method is based on a new first-order approximation for Langevin diffusions that exploits log-concavity to construct Markov chains with favourable convergence properties. This approximation is closely related to Moreau-Yoshida regularisations for convex functions and uses proximity mappings instead of gradient mappings to approximate the continuous-time process. The proposed method complements existing MALA methods in two ways. First, the method is shown to have very robust stability properties and to converge geometrically for many target densities for which other MALA are not geometric, or only if the step size is sufficiently small. Second, the method can be applied to high-dimensional target densities that are not continuously differentiable, a class of distributions that is increasingly used in image processing and machine learning and that is beyond the scope of existing MALA and HMC algorithms. To use this method it is necessary to compute or to approximate efficiently the proximity mappings of the logarithm of the target density. For several popular models, including many Bayesian models used in modern signal and image processing and machine learning, this can be achieved with convex optimisation algorithms and with approximations based on proximal splitting techniques, which can be implemented in parallel. The proposed method is demonstrated on two challenging high-dimensional and non-differentiable models related to image resolution enhancement and low-rank matrix estimation that are not well addressed by existing MCMC methodology.},

We introduce a new phenomenon, the infinite flow, and we study its fundamental properties and relations with the ergodicity and consensus. The central result is the infinite flow theorem establishing the equivalence between the infinite flow and the ergodicity for a class of independent random models, where the matrices in the model have a common steady state in expectation and a feedback property. For such models, this result demonstrates that the expected infinite flow is both necessary and sufficient for the ergodicity. The result is providing a deterministic characterization of the ergodicity, which can be used for studying the consensus and average consensus over random graphs.},

@article{Hegde2014,
abstract = {Compressive Sensing (CS) stipulates that a sparse signal can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements, and that this recovery can be performed efficiently in polynomial time. The framework of model-based compressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and prescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even further. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the model-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model that is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be computationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not sufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection problem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting models.   In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call approximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes a range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate solutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the aforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending the applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate this new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which is particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero coefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal) location. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization and the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph optimization techniques. Leveraging these algorithms into our framework results in a nearly sample-optimal sparse recovery scheme for the CEMD model.},

abstract = {This paper provides an extension of compressed sensing which bridges a substantial gap between existing theory and its current use in real-world applications. It introduces a mathematical framework that generalizes the three standard pillars of compressed sensing - namely, sparsity, incoherence and uniform random subsampling - to three new concepts: asymptotic sparsity, asymptotic incoherence and multilevel random sampling. The new theorems show that compressed sensing is also possible, and reveals several advantages, under these substantially relaxed conditions. The importance of this is threefold. First, inverse problems to which compressed sensing is currently applied are typically coherent. The new theory provides the first comprehensive mathematical explanation for a range of empirical usages of compressed sensing in real-world applications, such as medical imaging, microscopy, spectroscopy and others. Second, in showing that compressed sensing does not require incoherence, but instead that asymptotic incoherence is sufficient, the new theory offers markedly greater flexibility in the design of sensing mechanisms. Third, by using asymptotic incoherence and multi-level sampling to exploit not just sparsity, but also structure, i.e. asymptotic sparsity, the new theory shows that substantially improved reconstructions can be obtained from fewer measurements.},

The size of the dictionary and the patch-specific sparsity pattern are inferred from the data, in addition to other dictionary learning variables. Dictionary learning is performed directly on the compressed image, and so is tailored to the MRI being considered. In addition, we investigate a total variation penalty term in combination with the dictionary learning model, and show how the denoising property of dictionary learning removes dependence on regularization parameters in the noisy setting. We derive a stochastic optimization algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for the Bayesian model, and use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for efficiently performing total variation minimization. We present empirical results on several MRI, which show that the proposed regularization framework can improve reconstruction accuracy over other methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we follow the analysis and protocols of recent experiments, combined with simple theory, to arrive at a physical understanding of quasi-condensation in two dimensional Fermi gases. We find that quasi-condensation mirrors Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior in many ways, including the emergence of a strong zero momentum peak in the pair momentum distribution. Importantly, the disappearance of this quasi-condensate occurs at a reasonably well defined crossover temperature. The resulting phase diagram, pair momentum distribution, and algebraic power law decay are compatible with recent experiments throughout the continuum from BEC to BCS.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of 123 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshifts possessing an afterglow plateau phase. We reveal that \$L\_a-T\^{}\{*\}\_a\$ correlation between the X-ray luminosity \$L\_a\$ at the end of the plateau phase and the plateau duration, \$T\^{}*\_a\$, in the GRB rest frame has a power law slope different, within more than 2 \$\backslash sigma\$, from the slope of the prompt \$L\_\{f\}-T\^{}\{*\}\_\{f\}\$ correlation between the isotropic pulse peak luminosity, \$L\_\{f\}\$, and the pulse duration, \$T\^{}\{*\}\_\{f\}\$, from the time since the GRB ejection. Analogously, we show differences between the prompt and plateau phases in the energy-duration distributions with the afterglow emitted energy being on average \$10\backslash\%\$ of the prompt emission. Moreover, the distribution of prompt pulse versus afterglow spectral indexes do not show any correlation. In the further analysis we demonstrate that the \$L\_\{peak\}-L\_a\$ distribution, where \$L\_\{peak\}\$ is the peak luminosity from the start of the burst, is characterized with a considerably higher Spearman correlation coefficient, \$\backslash rho=0.79\$, than the one involving the averaged prompt luminosity, \$L\_\{prompt\}-L\_a\$, for the same GRB sample, yielding \$\backslash rho=0.60\$. Since some of this correlation could result from the redshift dependences of the luminosities, namely from their cosmological evolution we use the Efron-Petrosian method to reveal the intrinsic nature of this correlation. We find that a substantial part of the correlation is intrinsic. We apply a partial correlation coefficient to the new de-evolved luminosities showing that the intrinsic correlation exists.},

Although advanced search interfaces are widely available, most users still prefer to use keyword-based queries to search those documents. Query keywords often imply some hidden restrictions on the desired documents, which can be represented as document facet-value pairs. To achieve high retrieval performance, it's important to be able to identify the relevant facet-value pairs hidden in a query. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying document facet-value pairs that are relevant to a keyword-based search query.

For a long time, it has been recognized that looking at the dual of an optimization problem may drastically simplify its solution. Deriving efficient strategies which jointly brings into play the primal and the dual problems is however a more recent idea which has generated many important new contributions in the last years. These novel developments are grounded on recent advances in convex analysis, discrete optimization, parallel processing, and non-smooth optimization with emphasis on sparsity issues. In this paper, we aim at presenting the principles of primal-dual approaches, while giving an overview of numerical methods which have been proposed in different contexts. We show the benefits which can be drawn from primal-dual algorithms both for solving large-scale convex optimization problems and discrete ones, and we provide various application examples to illustrate their usefulness.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new rigorous theoretical framework to address discrete MRF-based optimization in computer vision. Such a framework exploits the powerful technique of Dual Decomposition. It is based on a projected subgradient scheme that attempts to solve an MRF optimization problem by first decomposing it into a set of appropriately chosen subproblems, and then combining their solutions in a principled way. In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful MRF optimization algorithms. For instance, in this manner we are able to derive algorithms that: 1) generalize and extend state-of-the-art message-passing methods, 2) optimize very tight LP-relaxations to MRF optimization, and 3) take full advantage of the special structure that may exist in particular MRFs, allowing the use of efficient inference techniques such as, e.g., graph-cut-based methods. Theoretical analysis on the bounds related with the different algorithms derived from our framework and experimental results/comparisons using synthetic and real data for a variety of tasks in computer vision demonstrate the extreme potentials of our approach.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing of signals drawn from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) admits closed-form minimum mean squared error reconstruction from incomplete linear measurements. An accurate GMM signal model is usually not available a priori, because it is difficult to obtain training signals that match the statistics of the signals being sensed. We propose to solve that problem by learning the signal model in situ, based directly on the compressive measurements of the signals, without resorting to other signals to train a model. A key feature of our method is that the signals being sensed are treated as random variables and are integrated out in the likelihood. We derive a maximum marginal likelihood estimator (MMLE) that maximizes the likelihood of the GMM of the underlying signals given only their linear compressive measurements. We extend the MMLE to a GMM with dominantly low-rank covariance matrices, to gain computational speedup. We report extensive experimental results on image inpainting, compressive sensing of high-speed video, and compressive hyperspectral imaging (the latter two based on real compressive cameras). The results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.},

Such models should consist of layers of various microsystems interconnected by a network of pathways, to form a macrosystem in a consistent way; that is, the observable characteristics of the macrosystem should be, at least asymptotically, derivable by aggregation of the appropriate features of the microsystems forming it, and from the properties of the network. In this paper we consider a general macromodel describing a population consisting of several interacting with each other subgroups, with the rules of interactions given by a system of ordinary differential equations, and we construct two different micromodels whose aggregated dynamics is approximately the same as that of the original macromodel. The micromodels offer a more detailed description of the original macromodel's dynamics by considering an internal structure of each subgroup. Here, each subgroup is represented by an edge of a graph with diffusion or transport occurring along it, while the interactions between the edges are described by interface conditions at the nodes joining them. We prove that with an appropriate scaling of such models, roughly speaking, with fast diffusion or transport combined with slow exchange at the nodes, the solutions of the micromodels are close to the solution to the macromodel.},

Is it possible to recover x\_0 accurately based on the data y?   To recover x\_0, we consider the solution x* to the l1-regularization problem min $\backslash$|x$\backslash$|\_1 subject to $\backslash$|Ax-y$\backslash$|\_2 <= epsilon, where epsilon is the size of the error term e. We show that if A obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns) and if the vector x\_0 is sufficiently sparse, then the solution is within the noise level $\backslash$|x* - x\_0$\backslash$|\_2 $\backslash$le C epsilon.   As a first example, suppose that A is a Gaussian random matrix, then stable recovery occurs for almost all such A's provided that the number of nonzeros of x\_0 is of about the same order as the number of observations. Second, suppose one observes few Fourier samples of x\_0, then stable recovery occurs for almost any set of p coefficients provided that the number of nonzeros is of the order of n/[$\backslash$log m]\^{}6. In the case where the error term vanishes, the recovery is of course exact, and this work actually provides novel insights on the exact recovery phenomenon discussed in earlier papers. The methodology also explains why one can also very nearly recover approximately sparse signals.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to characterize the best achievable performance for the problem of estimating an unknown parameter having a sparse representation. Specifically, we consider the setting in which a sparsely representable deterministic parameter vector is to be estimated from measurements corrupted by Gaussian noise, and derive a lower bound on the mean-squared error (MSE) achievable in this setting. To this end, an appropriate definition of bias in the sparse setting is developed, and the constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is obtained. This bound is shown to equal the CRB of an estimator with knowledge of the support set, for almost all feasible parameter values. Consequently, in the unbiased case, our bound is identical to the MSE of the oracle estimator. Combined with the fact that the CRB is achieved at high signal-to-noise ratios by the maximum likelihood technique, our result provides a new interpretation for the common practice of using the oracle estimator as a gold standard against which practical approaches are compared.},

However, when researchers can only access publicly-visible data, one quickly finds that social media users rarely publish location information. In this work, we provide a method which can geolocate the overwhelming majority of active Twitter users, independent of their location sharing preferences, using only publicly-visible Twitter data.   Our method infers an unknown user's location by examining their friend's locations. We frame the geotagging problem as an optimization over a social network with a total variation-based objective and provide a scalable and distributed algorithm for its solution. Furthermore, we show how a robust estimate of the geographic dispersion of each user's ego network can be used as a per-user accuracy measure which is effective at removing outlying errors.   Leave-many-out evaluation shows that our method is able to infer location for 101,846,236 Twitter users at a median error of 6.38 km, allowing us to geotag over 80$\backslash$\% of public tweets.},

abstract = {Persistent surveillance from camera networks, such as at parking lots, UAVs, etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation. Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios.},

abstract = {We present distributed algorithms that can be used by multiple agents to align their estimates with a particular value over a network with time-varying connectivity. Our framework is general in that this value can represent a consensus value among multiple agents or an optimal solution of an optimization problem, where the global objective function is a combination of local agent objective functions. Our main focus is on constrained problems where the estimate of each agent is restricted to lie in a different constraint set.   To highlight the effects of constraints, we first consider a constrained consensus problem and present a distributed ``projected consensus algorithm'' in which agents combine their local averaging operation with projection on their individual constraint sets. This algorithm can be viewed as a version of an alternating projection method with weights that are varying over time and across agents. We establish convergence and convergence rate results for the projected consensus algorithm. We next study a constrained optimization problem for optimizing the sum of local objective functions of the agents subject to the intersection of their local constraint sets. We present a distributed ``projected subgradient algorithm'' which involves each agent performing a local averaging operation, taking a subgradient step to minimize its own objective function, and projecting on its constraint set. We show that, with an appropriately selected stepsize rule, the agent estimates generated by this algorithm converge to the same optimal solution for the cases when the weights are constant and equal, and when the weights are time-varying but all agents have the same constraint set.},

abstract = {The production of energetic particles in the universe remains one of the great mysteries of modern science. The mechanisms of acceleration in astrophysical sources and the details about the propagation through the galactic and extragalactic media are still to be defined. In recent years, the cosmic ray flux has been measured with high precision in the energy range from $\backslash$energy\{10\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{20.5\} by several experiments using different techniques. In some energy ranges, it has been possible to determine the flux of individual elements (hydrogen to iron nuclei). This paper explores an astrophysical scenario in which only our Galaxy and the radio galaxy Cen A produce all particles measured on Earth in the energy range from $\backslash$energy\{10\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{20.5\}. Data from AMS-02, CREAM, KASCADE, KASCADE-Grande and the Pierre Auger Observatories are considered. The model developed here is able to describe the total and individual particle flux of all experiments considered. It is shown that the theory used here is able to describe the smooth transition from space-based to ground-based measurements. The flux of each element as determined by KASCADE and KASCADE-Grande and the mass sensitivity parameter $\backslash$xmax measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above $\backslash$energyEV\{18\} are also explored within the framework of the model. The transition from $\backslash$energy\{16\} to $\backslash$energyEV\{18\} is carefully analyzed. It is shown that the data measured in this energy range suggest the existence of an extra component of cosmic rays yet to be understood.},

abstract = {We analyze two communication-efficient algorithms for distributed statistical optimization on large-scale data sets. The first algorithm is a standard averaging method that distributes the \$N\$ data samples evenly to \$\backslash nummac\$ machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error that decays as \$\backslash order(N\^{}\{-1\}+(N/m)\^{}\{-2\})\$. Whenever \$m \backslash le \backslash sqrt\{N\}\$, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all \$\backslash totalnumobs\$ samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of bootstrap subsampling. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as \$\backslash order(N\^{}\{-1\} + (N/m)\^{}\{-3\})\$, and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. In addition, we show that a stochastic gradient-based method attains mean-squared error decaying as \$O(N\^{}\{-1\} + (N/ m)\^{}\{-3/2\})\$, easing computation at the expense of penalties in the rate of convergence. We also provide experimental evaluation of our methods, investigating their performance both on simulated data and on a large-scale regression problem from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods can be used to efficiently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which involves logistic regression with \$N \backslash approx 2.4 \backslash times 10\^{}8\$ samples and \$d \backslash approx 740,000\$ covariates.},

abstract = {This paper presents an efficient constant-time bilateral filter that produces a near-optimal performance tradeoff between approximate accuracy and computational complexity without any complicated parameter adjustment, called a compressive bilateral filter (CBLF). The constant-time means that the computational complexity is independent of its filter window size. Although many existing constant-time bilateral filters have been proposed step-by-step to pursue a more efficient performance tradeoff, they have less focused on the optimal tradeoff for their own frameworks. It is important to discuss this question, because it can reveal whether or not a constant-time algorithm still has plenty room for improvements of performance tradeoff. This paper tackles the question from a viewpoint of compressibility and highlights the fact that state-of-the-art algorithms have not yet touched the optimal tradeoff. The CBLF achieves a near-optimal performance tradeoff by two key ideas: 1) an approximate Gaussian range kernel through Fourier analysis and 2) a period length optimization. Experiments demonstrate that the CBLF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of approximate accuracy, computational complexity, and usability.},

In this paper we study the relative merits of either choice, providing empirical and theoretical guidelines for the selection of a measurement scheme. We provide empirical evidence based on experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk that in a variety of tasks, (pairwise-comparative) ordinal measurements have lower per sample noise and are typically faster to elicit than cardinal ones. Ordinal measurements however typically provide less information. We then consider the popular Thurstone and Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) models for ordinal measurements and characterize the minimax error rates for estimating the unknown quantity. We compare these minimax error rates to those under cardinal measurement models and quantify for what noise levels ordinal measurements are better. Finally, we revisit the data collected from our experiments and show that fitting these models confirms this prediction: for tasks where the noise in ordinal measurements is sufficiently low, the ordinal approach results in smaller errors in the estimation.},

abstract = {The fundamental principle underlying compressed sensing is that a signal, which is sparse under some basis representation, can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements. However, prior knowledge of the sparsity basis is essential for the recovery process. This work introduces the concept of blind compressed sensing, which avoids the need to know the sparsity basis in both the sampling and the recovery process. We suggest three possible constraints on the sparsity basis that can be added to the problem in order to make its solution unique. For each constraint we prove conditions for uniqueness, and suggest a simple method to retrieve the solution. Under the uniqueness conditions, and as long as the signals are sparse enough, we demonstrate through simulations that without knowing the sparsity basis our methods can achieve results similar to those of standard compressed sensing, which relay on prior knowledge of the sparsity basis. This offers a general sampling and reconstruction system that fits all sparse signals, regardless of the sparsity basis, under the conditions and constraints presented in this work.},

This may lead to a decrease in the power consumption or the manufacturing price of wireless receivers using spread spectrum technology. The main novelty of this paper is the discovery that in spread spectrum systems it is possible to apply compressive sensing with a much simpler hardware architecture than in other systems, making the implementation both simpler and more energy efficient. Our theoretical work is exemplified with a numerical experiment using the IEEE 802.15.4 standard's 2.4 GHz band specification. The numerical results support our theoretical findings and indicate that compressive sensing may be used successfully in spread spectrum communication systems. The results obtained here may also be applicable in other spread spectrum technologies, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a sparse recovery algorithm called detection-directed (DD) sparse estimation using Bayesian hypothesis test (BHT) and belief propagation (BP). In this framework, we consider the use of sparse-binary sensing matrices which has the tree-like property and the sampled-message approach for the implementation of BP.   The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is that the recovery takes DD-estimation structure consisting of two parts: support detection and signal value estimation. BP and BHT perform the support detection, and an MMSE estimator finds the signal values using the detected support set. The proposed algorithm provides noise-robustness against measurement noise beyond the conventional MAP approach, as well as a solution to remove quantization effect by the sampled-message based BP independently of memory size for the message sampling.   We explain how the proposed algorithm can have the aforementioned characteristics via exemplary discussion. In addition, our experiments validate such superiority of the proposed algorithm, compared to recent algorithms under noisy setup. Interestingly the experimental results show that performance of the proposed algorithm approaches that of the oracle estimator as SNR becomes higher.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a simple correlation-based strategy for estimating the unknown delay and amplitude of a signal based on a small number of noisy, randomly chosen frequency-domain samples. We model the output of this "compressive matched filter" as a random process whose mean equals the scaled, shifted autocorrelation function of the template signal. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we prove that the expected maximum deviation of this process from its mean decreases sharply as the number of measurements increases, and we also derive a probabilistic tail bound on the maximum deviation. Putting all of this together, we bound the minimum number of measurements required to guarantee that the empirical maximum of this random process occurs sufficiently close to the true peak of its mean function. We conclude that for broad classes of signals, this compressive matched filter will successfully estimate the unknown delay (with high probability, and within a prescribed tolerance) using a number of random frequency-domain samples that scales inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio and only logarithmically in the in the observation bandwidth and the possible range of delays.},

To date, all reconstruction methods proposed for this class of signals assumed knowledge of the band locations. In this paper, we develop a non-linear blind perfect reconstruction scheme for multi-band signals which does not require the band locations. Our approach assumes an existing blind multi-coset sampling method. The sparse structure of multi-band signals in the continuous frequency domain is used to replace the continuous reconstruction with a single finite dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem can be formulated within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.},

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae have been proposed to be much better distance indicators at near-infrared compared to optical wavelengths -- the effect of dust extinction is expected to be lower and it has been shown that SNe Ia behave more like `standard candles' at NIR wavelengths. To better understand the physical processes behind this increased uniformity, we have studied the \$Y\$, \$J\$ and \$H\$-filter light curves of 91 SNe Ia from the literature. We show that the phases and luminosities of the first maximum in the NIR light curves are extremely uniform for our sample. The phase of the second maximum, the late-phase NIR luminosity and the optical light curve shape are found to be strongly correlated, in particular more luminous SNe Ia reach the second maximum in the NIR filters at a later phase compared to fainter objects. We also find a strong correlation between the phase of the second maximum and the epoch at which the SN enters the Lira law phase in its optical colour curve (epochs \$\backslash sim\$ 15 to 30 days after \$B\$ band maximum). The decline rate after the second maximum is very uniform in all NIR filters. We suggest that these observational parameters are linked to the nickel and iron mass in the explosion, providing evidence that the amount of nickel synthesised in the explosion is the dominating factor shaping the optical and NIR appearance of SNe Ia.},

For baryons, the signal-to-noise problem often restricts one to time separations that are not ideally long, and for which couplings to excited states can obstruct the isolation of ground-state baryon properties. We consider excited-state contamination in nucleon two- and three-point functions. Using chiral perturbation theory, we determine couplings to pion-nucleon and pion-delta excited states. In two-point functions, these contributions are small, in accordance with general properties of the spectral weights on a torus. For the axial-current correlation function in the nucleon, the sign of excited-state contributions suggests overestimation of the nucleon axial charge. Thus contamination from pion-nucleon excited states will not likely explain the trend in lattice QCD data.},

abstract = {Let \$H(x,p)\$ be a Tonelli Hamiltonian defined on \$\backslash mathbb\{T\}\^{}d \backslash times \backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}d\$. We show how to approximate the solutions of the cell equation \$H(x,d\_xu)=\backslash bar H\$ by discrete weak KAM solutions. The cell equation is a degenerate PDE of first order that can be solved using the weak KAM theory developed by Mather and Fathi [Mat91, Mat93, Fat08]. Discrete weak KAM theory is similar to the Frenkel-Kontorova theory developed by Aubry and Le Daeron [ALD83] or Chou and Griffiths [CG86] in dimension one. The theory has then been more thoroughly developed by Gomes [Gom05] and by Garibaldi and Thieullen [GT11] in higher dimension. The discrete weak KAM approach approximates the Lagrangian trajectories by one-dimensional chains of atoms. By introducing a family of discrete actions \$\backslash\{\backslash mathcal\{L\}\_\backslash tau(x,y)\backslash\}\_\{\backslash tau>0\}\$ related to the Legendre-Fenchel transform of \$H\$, we show that the solutions of additive eigenvalue problem \$u\_\backslash tau(y) + \backslash bar\{\backslash mathcal\{L\}\}\_\backslash tau=\backslash inf\_\{x\backslash in\backslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}d\} \backslash\{ u\_\backslash tau(x)+\backslash mathcal\{L\}\_\backslash tau(x,y) \backslash\}\$ with unknowns \$(\backslash bar\{\backslash mathcal\{L\}\}\_\backslash tau,u\_\backslash tau)\$ converges in a sense to be defined to a solution of the cell equation with unknowns \$(\backslash bar H,u)\$.},

In order to minimize a convex function \$f(\backslash mathbf\{x\})\$, our algorithm introduces a simple line search step after each proximal gradient step in APG so that a biconvex function \$f(\backslash theta\backslash mathbf\{x\})\$ is minimized over scalar variable \$\backslash theta>0\$ while fixing variable \$\backslash mathbf\{x\}\$. We propose two new ways of constructing the auxiliary variables in APG based on the intermediate solutions of the proximal gradient and the line search steps. We prove that at arbitrary iteration step \$t (t\backslash geq1)\$, our algorithm can achieve a smaller upper-bound for the gap between the current and optimal objective values than those in the traditional APG methods such as FISTA, making it converge faster in practice. In fact, our algorithm can be potentially applied to many important convex optimization problems, such as sparse linear regression and kernel SVMs. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that our algorithm converges faster than APG in all of the applications above, even comparable to some sophisticated solvers.},

This problem is highly relevant in the recovery of dynamic MRI data with high spatio-temporal resolution, where each column of the matrix corresponds to a frame in the image time series; the matrix is highly low-rank since the frames are highly correlated. Similarly the non-zero locations of the matrix in appropriate transform/frame domains (e.g. wavelet, gradient) are roughly the same in different frame. The superset of the support can be safely assumed to be jointly sparse. Unlike the classical multiple measurement vector (MMV) setup that measures all the snapshots using the same matrix, we consider each snapshot to be measured using a different measurement matrix. We show that this approach reduces the total number of measurements, especially when the rank of the matrix is much smaller than than its sparsity. Our experiments in the context of dynamic imaging shows that this approach is very useful in realizing free breathing cardiac MRI.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing has a wide range of applications that include error correction, imaging, radar and many more. Given a sparse signal in a high dimensional space, one wishes to reconstruct that signal accurately and efficiently from a number of linear measurements much less than its actual dimension. Although in theory it is clear that this is possible, the difficulty lies in the construction of algorithms that perform the recovery efficiently, as well as determining which kind of linear measurements allow for the reconstruction. There have been two distinct major approaches to sparse recovery that each present different benefits and shortcomings. The first, L1-minimization methods such as Basis Pursuit, use a linear optimization problem to recover the signal. This method provides strong guarantees and stability, but relies on Linear Programming, whose methods do not yet have strong polynomially bounded runtimes. The second approach uses greedy methods that compute the support of the signal iteratively. These methods are usually much faster than Basis Pursuit, but until recently had not been able to provide the same guarantees. This gap between the two approaches was bridged when we developed and analyzed the greedy algorithm Regularized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (ROMP). ROMP provides similar guarantees to Basis Pursuit as well as the speed of a greedy algorithm. Our more recent algorithm Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) improves upon these guarantees, and is optimal in every important aspect.},

abstract = {Clustering provides a common means of identifying structure in complex data, and there is renewed interest in clustering as a tool for the analysis of large data sets in many fields. A natural question is how many clusters are appropriate for the description of a given system. Traditional approaches to this problem are based on either a framework in which clusters of a particular shape are assumed as a model of the system or on a two-step procedure in which a clustering criterion determines the optimal assignments for a given number of clusters and a separate criterion measures the goodness of the classification to determine the number of clusters. In a statistical mechanics approach, clustering can be seen as a trade-off between energy- and entropy-like terms, with lower temperature driving the proliferation of clusters to provide a more detailed description of the data. For finite data sets, we expect that there is a limit to the meaningful structure that can be resolved and therefore a minimum temperature beyond which we will capture sampling noise. This suggests that correcting the clustering criterion for the bias that arises due to sampling errors will allow us to find a clustering solution at a temperature that is optimal in the sense that we capture maximal meaningful structure--without having to define an external criterion for the goodness or stability of the clustering. We show that in a general information-theoretic framework, the finite size of a data set determines an optimal temperature, and we introduce a method for finding the maximal number of clusters that can be resolved from the data in the hard clustering limit.},

abstract = {A trend in compressed sensing (CS) is to exploit structure for improved reconstruction performance. In the basic CS model, exploiting the clustering structure among nonzero elements in the solution vector has drawn much attention, and many algorithms have been proposed. However, few algorithms explicitly consider correlation within a cluster. Meanwhile, in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model correlation among multiple solution vectors is largely ignored. Although several recently developed algorithms consider the exploitation of the correlation, these algorithms need to know a priori the correlation structure, thus limiting their effectiveness in practical problems.   Recently, we developed a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm, namely T-SBL, and its variants, which adaptively learn the correlation structure and exploit such correlation information to significantly improve reconstruction performance. Here we establish their connections to other popular algorithms, such as the group Lasso, iterative reweighted \$\backslash ell\_1\$ and \$\backslash ell\_2\$ algorithms, and algorithms for time-varying sparsity. We also provide strategies to improve these existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Approval-like voting rules, such as Sincere-Strategy Preference-Based Approval voting (SP-AV), the Bucklin rule (an adaptive variant of \$k\$-Approval voting), and the Fallback rule (an adaptive variant of SP-AV) have many desirable properties: for example, they are easy to understand and encourage the candidates to choose electoral platforms that have a broad appeal. In this paper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity of electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that can be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate upwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of candidates they approve of. We show that finding an optimal campaign management strategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback. In contrast, the second method is computationally hard even if the degree to which we need to affect the votes is small. Nevertheless, we identify a large class of scenarios that admit fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.},

Individual nodes in a network receive noisy local (private) observations whose distribution is parameterized by a discrete parameter (hypotheses). The conditional distributions are known locally at the nodes, but the true parameter/hypothesis is not known. An update rule is analyzed in which nodes first perform a Bayesian update of their belief (distribution estimate) of the parameter based on their local observation, communicate these updates to their neighbors, and then perform a "non-Bayesian" linear consensus using the log-beliefs of their neighbors. In this paper we show that under mild assumptions, the belief of any node in any incorrect hypothesis converges to zero exponentially fast, and we characterize the exponential rate of learning which is given in terms of the network structure and the divergences between the observations' distributions. Our main result is the concentration property established on the rate of convergence.},

abstract = {The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to acquire and stably recover sparse signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but also quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth. In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the emphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In particular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d. random Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with overwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the Binary \$\backslash epsilon\$-Stable Embedding (B\$\backslash epsilon\$SE) property, which characterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the same class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm for signal reconstruction from 1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance.},

The second-order term in the large-\$n\$ expansion of the maximal channel coding rate is characterized both for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and for quasi-static fading channels with perfect channel state information available at both the transmitter and the receiver. It is shown that in both cases the second-order term is proportional to \$\backslash sqrt\{n\^{}\{-1\}\backslash ln n\}\$. For the quasi-static fading case, this second-order term is achieved by truncated channel inversion, namely, by concatenating a dispersion-optimal code for an AWGN channel subject to a short-term power constraint, with a power controller that inverts the channel whenever the fading gain is above a certain threshold. Easy-to-evaluate approximations of the maximal channel coding rate are developed for both the AWGN and the quasi-static fading case.},

A novel low-complexity, scale-normalized feature called Histogram of Moving Gradients (HoMG) is introduced for highly effective spatiotemporal representation of individuals and crowds within a video. Real-time crowd segmentation is achieved via boosted cascade of weak classifiers based on sliding-window HoMG features, while linear SVM regression of crowd-region HoMG features is employed for real-time crowd counting. Experimental results using multi-camera crowd datasets show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperform state-of-the-art crowd counting algorithms, as well as achieve very promising crowd segmentation results, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method for highly-accurate, real-time video-driven crowd analysis.},

abstract = {Goal: A new method for heart rate monitoring using photoplethysmography (PPG) during physical activities is proposed. Methods: It jointly estimates spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. Due to a common sparsity constraint on spectral coefficients, the method can easily identify and remove spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) in PPG spectra. Thus, it does not need any extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms. Furthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified. Results: Experimental results on 12 PPG datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded during subjects' fast running showed that it had high performance. The average absolute estimation error was 1.28 beat per minute and the standard deviation was 2.61 beat per minute. Conclusion and Significance: These results show that the method has great potential to be used for PPG-based heart rate monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring.},

This enables us to join the exceptional convergence properties of primal-dual interior-point methods with the remarkable parallelizability of ADMM. The resulting algorithm has superior computational properties with respect to ADMM directly applied to our problem. The amount of computations that needs to be conducted by each computing agent is far less. In particular, the updates for all variables can be expressed in closed form, irrespective of the type of optimization problem. The most expensive computational burden of the algorithm occur in the updates of the primal variables and can be precomputed in each iteration of the interior-point method.

Our approach also provides more flexibilities in terms of the dimension of CS matrices. As a consequence, our construction yields an approximately mutually unbiased bases from Fourier matrices which is of particular interest to quantum information theory.

abstract = {Multi-User Detection is fundamental not only to cellular wireless communication but also to Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology that supports supply chain management. The challenge of Multi-user Detection (MUD) is that of demodulating mutually interfering signals, and the two biggest impediments are the asynchronous character of random access and the lack of channel state information. Given that at any time instant the number of active users is typically small, the promise of Compressive Sensing (CS) is the demodulation of sparse superpositions of signature waveforms from very few measurements. This paper begins by unifying two front-end architectures proposed for MUD by showing that both lead to the same discrete signal model. Algorithms are presented for coherent and noncoherent detection that are based on iterative matching pursuit. Noncoherent detection is all that is needed in the application to RFID technology where it is only the identity of the active users that is required. The coherent detector is also able to recover the transmitted symbols. It is shown that compressive demodulation requires \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}(K\backslash log N(\backslash tau+1))\$ samples to recover \$K\$ active users whereas standard MUD requires \$N(\backslash tau+1)\$ samples to process \$N\$ total users with a maximal delay \$\backslash tau\$. Performance guarantees are derived for both coherent and noncoherent detection that are identical in the way they scale with number of active users. The power profile of the active users is shown to be less important than the SNR of the weakest user. Gabor frames and Kerdock codes are proposed as signature waveforms and numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of Kerdock codes - the same probability of error with less than half the samples.},

If we adopt the link aging, we get a more modular structure with more homogeneously distributed link weights within communities than when link deletion is used.

To our knowledge, previously the best bound for \$\backslash sigma\$ was \$O(n\^{}2\backslash cdot 4\^{}\{n\^{}2\})\$ over algebraically closed fields of characteristic \$0\$ (Derksen, 2001).   In this article we prove the following results:   (1) We observe that by using an algorithm of Gurvits, and assuming the above bound \$\backslash sigma\$ for \$R(n, m)\$ over \$\backslash mathbb\{Q\}\$, deciding whether \$T\$ has non-commutative rank \$<n\$ over \$\backslash mathbb\{Q\}\$ can be done deterministically in time polynomial in the input size and \$\backslash sigma\$.   (2) When \$\backslash mathbb\{F\}\$ is large enough, we devise a deterministic algorithm for non-commutative Edmonds' problem in time polynomial in \$(n+1)!\$, with the following consequences.   (2.a) If the commutative rank and the non-commutative rank of \$T\$ differ by a constant, then there exists a randomized efficient algorithm that computes the non-commutative rank of \$T\$.   (2.b) We prove that \$\backslash sigma\backslash leq (n+1)!\$. This not only improves the bound obtained from Derksen's work over algebraically closed field of characteristic \$0\$ but, more importantly, also provides for the first time an explicit bound on \$\backslash sigma\$ for matrix semi-invariants over fields of positive characteristics.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of group testing with sum observations and noiseless answers, in which we aim to locate multiple objects by querying the number of objects in each of a sequence of chosen sets. We study a probabilistic setting with entropy loss, in which we assume a joint Bayesian prior density on the locations of the objects and seek to choose the sets queried to minimize the expected entropy of the Bayesian posterior distribution after a fixed number of questions. We present a new non-adaptive policy, called the dyadic policy, show it is optimal among non-adaptive policies, and is within a factor of two of optimal among adaptive policies. This policy is quick to compute, its nonadaptive nature makes it easy to parallelize, and our bounds show it performs well even when compared with adaptive policies. We also study an adaptive greedy policy, which maximizes the one-step expected reduction in entropy, and show that it performs at least as well as the dyadic policy, offering greater query efficiency but reduced parallelism. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both procedures outperform a divide-and-conquer benchmark policy from the literature, called sequential bifurcation, and show how these procedures may be applied in a stylized computer vision problem.},

abstract = {Most work on wireless network resource allocation use physical layer performance such as sum rate and outage probability as the figure of merit. These metrics may not reflect the true user QoS in future heterogenous networks (HetNets) with many small cells, due to large traffic variations in overlapping cells with complicated interference conditions. This paper studies the spectrum allocation problem in HetNets using the average packet sojourn time as the performance metric. To be specific, in a HetNet with \$K\$ base terminal stations (BTS's), we determine the optimal partition of the spectrum into \$2\^{}K\$ possible spectrum sharing combinations. We use an interactive queueing model to characterize the flow level performance, where the service rates are decided by the spectrum partition. The spectrum allocation problem is formulated using a conservative approximation, which makes the optimization problem convex. We prove that in the optimal solution the spectrum is divided into at most \$K\$ pieces. A numerical algorithm is provided to solve the spectrum allocation problem on a slow timescale with aggregate traffic and service information. Simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves significant gains compared to both orthogonal and full spectrum reuse allocations with moderate to heavy traffic.},

abstract = {Sparse linear (or generalized linear) models combine a standard likelihood function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefficients. These priors can conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with different variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefficients, while an empirical Bayesian alternative (Type II) first marginalizes the coefficients and then maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior approximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space framework from Wipf et al. (2011), which allows both the Type I or Type II objectives to be expressed in either coefficient or hyperparmeter space. This perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to development in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data fit. As this parameter is effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to solve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefficient-space techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful recovering sparse coefficients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties (RIP) lead to failure of popular L1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable integrations.},

For high-dimensional minimization problems involving large datasets or many unknowns, the forward-backward splitting method provides a simple, practical solver. Despite its apparently simplicity, the performance of the forward-backward splitting is highly sensitive to implementation details.   This article is an introductory review of forward-backward splitting with a special emphasis on practical implementation concerns. Issues like stepsize selection, acceleration, stopping conditions, and initialization are considered. Numerical experiments are used to compare the effectiveness of different approaches.   Many variations of forward-backward splitting are implemented in the solver FASTA (short for Fast Adaptive Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm). FASTA provides a simple interface for applying forward-backward splitting to a broad range of problems.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods.},

abstract = {The conventional fluid description of multi-component plasma, supplemented by an appropriate equation of state for the macroparticle component, is used to evaluate the longitudinal sound velocity of Yukawa fluids. The obtained results are in very good agreement with those obtained earlier employing the quasi-localized charge approximation and molecular dynamics simulations in a rather broad parameter regime. Thus, a simple yet accurate tool to estimate the sound velocity across coupling regimes is proposed, which can be particularly helpful in estimating the dust-acoustic velocity in strongly coupled dusty (complex) plasmas. It is shown that, within the present approach, the sound velocity is completely determined by particle-particle correlations and the neutralizing medium (plasma), apart from providing screening of the Coulomb interaction, has no other effect on the sound propagation. The ratio of the actual sound velocity to its "ideal gas" (weak coupling) scale only weakly depends on the coupling strength in the fluid regime, but exhibits a pronounced decrease with the increase of the screening strength. The limitations of the present approach in applications to real complex plasmas are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Gradient descent is an important class of iterative algorithms for minimizing convex functions. Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and synchronous process. Distributed and asynchronous variants of gradient descent have been studied since the 1980s, and they have been experiencing a resurgence due to demand from large-scale machine learning problems running on multi-core processors.   We provide a version of asynchronous gradient descent (AGD) in which communication between cores is minimal and for which there is little synchronization overhead. We also propose a new timing model for its analysis. With this model, we give the first amortized analysis of AGD on convex functions. The amortization allows for bad updates (updates that increase the value of the convex function); in contrast, most prior work makes the strong assumption that every update must be significantly improving.   Typically, the step sizes used in AGD are smaller than those used in its synchronous counterpart. We provide a method to determine the step sizes in AGD based on the Hessian entries for the convex function. In certain circumstances, the resulting step sizes are a constant fraction of those used in the corresponding synchronous algorithm, enabling the overall performance of AGD to improve linearly with the number of cores.   We give two applications of our amortized analysis.},

abstract = {Modern statistical machine translation (SMT) systems usually use a linear combination of features to model the quality of each translation hypothesis. The linear combination assumes that all the features are in a linear relationship and constrains that each feature interacts with the rest features in an linear manner, which might limit the expressive power of the model and lead to a under-fit model on the current data. In this paper, we propose a non-linear modeling for the quality of translation hypotheses based on neural networks, which allows more complex interaction between features. A learning framework is presented for training the non-linear models. We also discuss possible heuristics in designing the network structure which may improve the non-linear learning performance. Experimental results show that with the basic features of a hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system, our method produce translations that are better than a linear model.},

The system combines the inherent sensitivity of QCLs to optical re-injection and their ultra-stability in the strong feedback regime where nonlinear frequency mixing phenomena are enhanced. An experimental proof of principle in the micrometer wavelength scale is provided. We perform real-time measurements of displacement with \{$\backslash$lambda\}/100 resolution by inserting a fast-shifting reference etalon in the external cavity. The resulting signal dynamics at the QCL terminals shows a stroboscopic-like effect that relates the sensor resolution with the reference etalon speed. Intrinsic limits to the measurement algorithm and to the reference speed are discussed, disclosing that nanoscale ranges are attainable.},

abstract = {We introduce a method for proving lower bounds on the efficacy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations for combinatorial problems. In particular, we show that the cut, TSP, and stable set polytopes on \$n\$-vertex graphs are not the linear image of the feasible region of any SDP (i.e., any spectrahedron) of dimension less than \$2\^{}\{n\^{}c\}\$, for some constant \$c > 0\$. This result yields the first super-polynomial lower bounds on the semidefinite extension complexity of any explicit family of polytopes.   Our results follow from a general technique for proving lower bounds on the positive semidefinite rank of a matrix. To this end, we establish a close connection between arbitrary SDPs and those arising from the sum-of-squares SDP hierarchy. For approximating maximum constraint satisfaction problems, we prove that SDPs of polynomial-size are equivalent in power to those arising from degree-\$O(1)\$ sum-of-squares relaxations. This result implies, for instance, that no family of polynomial-size SDP relaxations can achieve better than a 7/8-approximation for MAX-3-SAT.},

abstract = {The question of aggregating pair-wise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR's TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding `scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences.   In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g. each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order-optimal.},

It is important to note that, unlike in the classical case, there are many inequivalent ways to define the Renyi divergence of states, and hence the R$\backslash$'enyi capacities of channels. Our exponent is in terms of the Renyi capacities corresponding to a version of the Renyi divergences that has been introduced recently in [M$\backslash$"uller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J.

abstract = {A time-domain numerical code based on the constitutive relations of nonlinear acoustics for simulating ultrasound propagation is presented. To model frequency power law attenuation, such as observed in biological media, multiple relaxation processes are included and relaxation parameters are fitted to both exact frequency power law attenuation and empirically measured attenuation of a variety of tissues that does not fit an exact power law. A computational technique based on artificial relaxation is included to correct the non-negligible numerical dispersion of the numerical method and to improve stability when shock waves are present. This technique avoids the use of high order finite difference schemes, leading to fast calculations. The numerical code is especially suitable to study high intensity and focused axisymmetric acoustic beams in tissue-like medium, as it is based on the full constitutive relations that overcomes the limitations of the parabolic approximations, while some specific effects not contemplated by the Westervelt equation can be also studied. The accuracy of the method is discussed by comparing the proposed simulation solutions to one-dimensional analytical ones, to \$k\$-space numerical solutions and also to experimental data from a focused beam propagating in a frequency power law attenuation media.},

It also shows that stability and performance of such control systems can be verified with a complexity that scales linearly with the number of interconnections. Several results regarding scalable synthesis and verfication are derived, including a new stronger version of the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma for positive systems.

abstract = {In this paper we address an important economic question. Is there, as mainstream economic theory asserts it, an homogeneous labor market with mechanisms which govern supply and demand for work, producing an equilibrium with its remarkable properties? Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) collected on the period 1984-2003, we study the situations of American workers with respect to employment. The data include all heads of household (men or women) as well as the partners who are on the labor market, working or not. They are extracted from the complete survey and we compute a few relevant features which characterize the worker's situations. To perform this analysis, we suggest using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM, Kohonen algorithm) with specific structure based on planar graphs, with disconnected components (called D-SOM), especially interesting for clustering. We compare the results to those obtained with a classical SOM grid and a star-shaped map (called SOS). Each component of D-SOM takes the form of a string and corresponds to an organized cluster. From this clustering, we study the trajectories of the individuals among the classes by using the transition probability matrices for each period and the corresponding stationary distributions. As a matter of fact, we find clear evidence of heterogeneous parts, each one with high homo-geneity, representing situations well identified in terms of activity and wage levels and in degree of stability in the workplace. These results and their interpretation in economic terms contribute to the debate about flexibility which is commonly seen as a way to obtain a better level of equilibrium on the labor market.},

abstract = {Autoencoders are popular feature learning models, that are conceptually simple, easy to train and allow for efficient inference. Recent work has shown how certain autoencoders can be associated with an energy landscape, akin to negative log-probability in a probabilistic model, which measures how well the autoencoder can represent regions in the input space. The energy landscape has been commonly inferred heuristically, by using a training criterion that relates the autoencoder to a probabilistic model such as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). In this paper we show how most common autoencoders are naturally associated with an energy function, independent of the training procedure, and that the energy landscape can be inferred analytically by integrating the reconstruction function of the autoencoder. For autoencoders with sigmoid hidden units, the energy function is identical to the free energy of an RBM, which helps shed light onto the relationship between these two types of model. We also show that the autoencoder energy function allows us to explain common regularization procedures, such as contractive training, from the perspective of dynamical systems. As a practical application of the energy function, a generative classifier based on class-specific autoencoders is presented.},

abstract = {We prove a lower estimate on the increase in entropy when two copies of a conditional random variable \$X | Y\$, with \$X\$ supported on \$\backslash mathbb\{Z\}\_q=\backslash\{0,1,\backslash dots,q-1\backslash\}\$ for prime \$q\$, are summed modulo \$q\$. Specifically, given two i.i.d copies \$(X\_1,Y\_1)\$ and \$(X\_2,Y\_2)\$ of a pair of random variables \$(X,Y)\$, with \$X\$ taking values in \$\backslash mathbb\{Z\}\_q\$, we show $\backslash$[ H(X\_1 + X\_2 $\backslash$mid Y\_1, Y\_2) - H(X|Y) $\backslash$ge $\backslash$alpha(q) $\backslash$cdot H(X|Y) (1-H(X|Y)) $\backslash$] for some \$\backslash alpha(q) > 0\$, where \$H(\backslash cdot)\$ is the normalized (by factor \$\backslash log\_2 q\$) entropy. Our motivation is an effective analysis of the finite-length behavior of polar codes, and the assumption of \$q\$ being prime is necessary. For \$X\$ supported on infinite groups without a finite subgroup and no conditioning, a sumset inequality for the absolute increase in (unnormalized) entropy was shown by Tao (2010).   We use our sumset inequality to analyze Ar\{$\backslash$i\}kan's construction of polar codes and prove that for any \$q\$-ary source \$X\$, where \$q\$ is any fixed prime, and any \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$, polar codes allow \{$\backslash$em efficient\} data compression of \$N\$ i.i.d. copies of \$X\$ into \$(H(X)+\backslash epsilon)N\$ \$q\$-ary symbols, as soon as \$N\$ is polynomially large in \$1/\backslash epsilon\$. We can get capacity-achieving source codes with similar guarantees for composite alphabets, by factoring \$q\$ into primes and combining different polar codes for each prime in factorization.   A consequence of our result for noisy channel coding is that for \{$\backslash$em all\} discrete memoryless channels, there are explicit codes enabling reliable communication within \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$ of the symmetric Shannon capacity for a block length and decoding complexity bounded by a polynomial in \$1/\backslash epsilon\$. The result was previously shown for the special case of binary input channels (Guruswami-Xia '13 and Hassani-Alishahi-Urbanke '13), and this work extends the result to channels over any alphabet.},

abstract = {Spectrum sensing is one of the enabling functionalities for cognitive radio (CR) systems to operate in the spectrum white space. To protect the primary incumbent users from interference, the CR is required to detect incumbent signals at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we present a spectrum sensing technique based on correlating spectra for detection of television (TV) broadcasting signals. The basic strategy is to correlate the periodogram of the received signal with the a priori known spectral features of the primary signal. We show that according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion, this spectral correlation-based sensing technique is asymptotically optimal at very low SNR and with a large sensing time. From the system design perspective, we analyze the effect of the spectral features on the spectrum sensing performance. Through the optimization analysis, we obtain useful insights on how to choose effective spectral features to achieve reliable sensing. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing technique can reliably detect analog and digital TV signals at SNR as low as -20 dB.},

In Study 2, participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes than their no-load counterparts. In Study 3, time pressure increased participants' endorsement of conservative terms. In Study 4, participants considering political terms in a cursory manner endorsed conservative terms more than those asked to cogitate; an indicator of effortful thought (recognition memory) partially mediated the relationship between processing effort and conservatism.

A positive bias voltage generates large EOF and small current, while negative voltages generate small EOF and large current. Here we systematically investigate this effect using finite-element simulations. We find that inside the pore, the electric field and salt concentration are inversely correlated, which leads to the inverse relationship between the magnitudes of EOF and current. Rectification occurs when the pore is driven into states characterized by different salt concentrations depending on the sign of the voltage. The mechanism responsible for this behaviour is concentration polarization, which requires the pore to exhibit the properties of permselectivity and asymmetry.},

One specific proposal being considered by the 3GPP is to retool and deploy Long Term Evolution (LTE) technologies in unlicensed bands. This paper studies the fundamental questions of whether and how the unlicensed spectrum can be shared by intrinsically selfish operators. Because the operators can be strategic, the questions is studied in a game theoretic setting. A mechanism is proposed for operators to share the spectrum in a given area and reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, so that any operator will only suffer loss by unilaterally deviating from the equilibrium. It is shown that the number of strategic operators willing to invest is limited due to entry barriers and externalities. These results suggest spectrum sharing mechanisms for the deployment of LTE in unlicensed bands.},

abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital precoding offers a compromise between hardware complexity and system performance in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. This type of precoding allows mmWave systems to leverage large antenna array gains that are necessary for sufficient link margin, while permitting low cost and power consumption hardware. Most prior work has focused on hybrid precoding for narrowband mmWave systems, with perfect or estimated channel knowledge at the transmitter. MmWave systems, however, will likely operate on wideband channels with frequency selectivity. Therefore, this paper considers wideband mmWave systems with a limited feedback channel between the transmitter and receiver. First, the optimal hybrid precoding design for a given RF codebook is derived. This provides a benchmark for any other heuristic algorithm and gives useful insights into codebook designs. Second, efficient hybrid analog/digital codebooks are developed for spatial multiplexing in wideband mmWave systems. Finally, a low-complexity yet near-optimal greedy frequency selective hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. Simulation results show that the developed hybrid codebooks and precoder designs achieve very good performance compared with the unconstrained solutions while requiring much less complexity.},

abstract = {The observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events, such as photons hitting a detector, which cannot be effectively modeled using an additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a Poisson noise model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially or temporally distributed phenomenon (f*) from Poisson data (y) cannot be effectively accomplished by minimizing a conventional penalized least-squares objective function. The problem addressed in this paper is the estimation of f* from y in an inverse problem setting, where (a) the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the number of observations and (b) f* admits a sparse approximation. The optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a penalized negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative). In particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using separable quadratic approximations to the objective function at each iteration and penalization terms related to l1 norms of coefficient vectors, total variation seminorms, and partition-based multiscale estimation methods.},

abstract = {The problem of finding an optimal sensing schedule for a mobile device that encounters an intermittent WiFi access opportunity is considered. At any given time, the WiFi is in any of the two modes, ON or OFF, and the mobile's incentive is to connect to the WiFi in the ON mode as soon as possible, while spending as little sensing energy. We introduce a dynamic programming framework which enables the characterization of an explicit solution for several models, particularly when the OFF periods are exponentially distributed. While the problem for non-exponential OFF periods is ill-posed in general, a usual workaround in literature is to make the mobile device aware if one ON period is completely missed. In this restricted setting, using the DP framework, the deterministic nature of the optimal sensing policy is established, and value iterations are shown to converge to the optimal solution. Finally, we address the blind situation where the distributions of ON and OFF periods are unknown. A continuous bandit based learning algorithm that has vanishing regret (loss compared to the optimal strategy with the knowledge of distributions) is presented, and comparisons with the optimal schemes are provided for exponential ON and OFF times.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering fusion frame sparse signals from incomplete measurements. These signals are composed of a small number of nonzero blocks taken from a family of subspaces. First, we show that, by using a-priori knowledge of a coherence parameter associated with the angles between the subspaces, one can uniformly recover fusion frame sparse signals with a significantly reduced number of vector-valued (sub-)Gaussian measurements via mixed l\^{}1/l\^{}2-minimization. We prove this by establishing an appropriate version of the restricted isometry property. Our result complements previous nonuniform recovery results in this context, and provides stronger stability guarantees for noisy measurements and approximately sparse signals. Second, we determine the minimal number of scalar-valued measurements needed to uniformly recover all fusion frame sparse signals via mixed l\^{}1/l\^{}2-minimization. This bound is achieved by scalar-valued subgaussian measurements. In particular, our result shows that the number of scalar-valued subgaussian measurements cannot be further reduced using knowledge of the coherence parameter. As a special case it implies that the best known uniform recovery result for block sparse signals using subgaussian measurements is optimal.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {The discovery of particle filtering methods has enabled the use of nonlinear filtering in a wide array of applications. Unfortunately, the approximation error of particle filters typically grows exponentially in the dimension of the underlying model. This phenomenon has rendered particle filters of limited use in complex data assimilation problems. In this paper, we argue that it is often possible, at least in principle, to develop local particle filtering algorithms whose approximation error is dimension-free. The key to such developments is the decay of correlations property, which is a spatial counterpart of the much better understood stability property of nonlinear filters. For the simplest possible algorithm of this type, our results provide under suitable assumptions an approximation error bound that is uniform both in time and in the model dimension. More broadly, our results provide a framework for the investigation of filtering problems and algorithms in high dimension.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the early relationship between brain tumor cells and their environment could lead to more sensitive biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies. We have been using a rodent model of neurocarcinogenesis in which all animals develop brain tumors by six months of age to establish two early landmarks in glioma development: the appearance of a nestin(+) cell at thirty days of age and the appearance of cellular hyperplasia between 60 and 120 days of age. We now report an assessment of the CSF proteome to determine the changes in protein composition that occur during this period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nestin(+) cell clusters and microtumors were assessed in 63 ethylnitrosourea-exposed rats on 30, 60, and 90 days of age. CSF was obtained from the cisterna magna from 101 exposed and control rats at 30, 60, and 90 days and then analyzed using mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed peaks were isolated and identified.

RESULTS: Nestin(+) cells were noted in all ethylnitrosourea-exposed rats assessed pathologically. Small microtumors were noted in 0\%, 18\%, and 67\% of 30-, 60-, and 90-day old rats, respectively (p<0.05, Chi square). False Discovery Rate analysis of peak intensities showed that the number of true discoveries with p<0.05 increased markedly with increasing age. Isolation and identification of highly differentially detected proteins at 90 days of age revealed increases in albumin and a fragment of $\alpha$1 macroglobulin and alterations in glutathionylated transthyretin.

CONCLUSIONS: The presence of increased albumin, fragments of cerebrospinal fluid proteins, and glutathione breakdown in temporal association with the development of cellular hyperplasia, suggests that, similar to many other systemic cancers, inflammation and oxidative stress is playing an important early role in the host's response to brain tumor development and may be involved in affecting the early growth of brain tumor.},

The simplicity and availability of rankings such as Impact Factor, Eigenfactor and SciMago Journal Rank based on trusted commercial sources ensures their widespread use for many important tasks despite the well-known limitations of such rankings. In this paper we look at an alternative approach based on information on papers from social and mainstream media sources. Our data comes from altmetric.com who identify mentions of individual academic papers in sources such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs and news outlets. We consider several different methods to produce a ranking of journals from such data. We show that most (but not all) schemes produce results, which are roughly similar, suggesting that there is a basic consistency between social media based approaches and traditional citation based methods. Most ranking schemes applied to one data set produce relatively little variation and we suggest this provides a measure of the uncertainty in any journal rating. The differences we find between data sources also shows they are capturing different aspects of journal impact. We conclude a small number of such ratings will provide the best information on journal impact.},

abstract = {A simple random walk on a graph is a sequence of movements from one vertex to another where at each step an edge is chosen uniformly at random from the set of edges incident on the current vertex, and then transitioned to next vertex. Central to this thesis is the cover time of the walk, that is, the expectation of the number of steps required to visit every vertex, maximised over all starting vertices. In our first contribution, we establish a relation between the cover times of a pair of graphs, and the cover time of their Cartesian product. This extends previous work on special cases of the Cartesian product, in particular, the square of a graph. We show that when one of the factors is in some sense larger than the other, its cover time dominates, and can become within a logarithmic factor of the cover time of the product as a whole. Our main theorem effectively gives conditions for when this holds. The techniques and lemmas we introduce may be of independent interest. In our second contribution, we determine the precise asymptotic value of the cover time of a random graph with given degree sequence. This is a graph picked uniformly at random from all simple graphs with that degree sequence. We also show that with high probability, a structural property of the graph called conductance, is bounded below by a constant. This is of independent interest. Finally, we explore random walks with weighted random edge choices. We present a weighting scheme that has a smaller worst case cover time than a simple random walk. We give an upper bound for a random graph of given degree sequence weighted according to our scheme. We demonstrate that the speed-up (that is, the ratio of cover times) over a simple random walk can be unbounded},

abstract = {Linear programming (LP) decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes proposed by Feldman et al. is shown to have theoretical guarantees in several regimes and empirically is not observed to suffer from an error floor. However at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), LP decoding is observed to have worse error performance than belief propagation (BP) decoding. In this paper, we seek to improve LP decoding at low SNRs while still achieving good high SNR performance. We first present a new decoding framework obtained by trying to solve a non-convex optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This non-convex problem is constructed by adding a penalty term to the LP decoding objective. The goal of the penalty term is to make "pseudocodewords", which are the non-integer vertices of the LP relaxation to which the LP decoder fails, more costly. We name this decoder class the "ADMM penalized decoder". In our simulation results, the ADMM penalized decoder with \$\backslash ell\_1\$ and \$\backslash ell\_2\$ penalties outperforms both BP and LP decoding at all SNRs. For high SNR regimes where it is infeasible to simulate, we use an instanton analysis and show that the ADMM penalized decoder has better high SNR performance than BP decoding. We also develop a reweighted LP decoder using linear approximations to the objective with an \$\backslash ell\_1\$ penalty. We show that this decoder has an improved theoretical recovery threshold compared to LP decoding. In addition, we show that the empirical gain of the reweighted LP decoder is significant at low SNRs.},

A novel probabilistic pooling operation is integrated into the deep model, yielding efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic learning.

To speed up this inference, a new statistical approach is proposed to project the top-layer dictionary elements to the data level. Following this, only one layer of deconvolution is required during testing. Experimental results demonstrate powerful capabilities of the model to learn multi-layer features from images.

abstract = {Wideband spectrum sensing is becoming increasingly important to cognitive radio (CR) systems for exploiting spectral opportunities. This paper introduces a novel multi-rate sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing (MS3) system that implements cooperative wideband spectrum sensing in a CR network. MS3 can detect the wideband spectrum using partial measurements without reconstructing the full frequency spectrum. Sub-Nyquist sampling rates are adopted in sampling channels for wrapping the frequency spectrum onto itself. This significantly reduces sensing requirements of CR. The effects of sub-Nyquist sampling are considered, and the performance of multi-channel sub-Nyquist samplings is analyzed. To improve its detection performance, sub-Nyquist sampling rates are chosen to be different such that the numbers of samples are consecutive prime numbers. Furthermore, when the received signals at CRs are faded or shadowed, the performance of MS3 is analytically evaluated. Numerical results show that the proposed system can significantly enhance the wideband spectrum sensing performance while requiring low computational and implementation complexities.},

abstract = {Astrophysical dynamo theories provide various mechanisms for magnetic field amplification inside galaxies, where weak initial fields grow exponentially on various timescales. We investigate the particular role played by stellar feedback mechanisms in creating strong fluid turbulence, allowing for a magnetic dynamo to emerge. Performing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated cooling halos, for both dwarf and Milky Way sized objects, we compare the magnetic field evolution for various initial field topologies and various stellar feedback mechanisms. We find that feedback can indeed drive strong gas turbulence which gives rise to a fast exponential magnetic field growth. Our simulations feature typical properties of Kolmogorov turbulence with a \$k \^{}\{-5/3\}\$ kinetic energy spectrum, as well as the characteristic properties of a small-scale dynamo, with a \$k\^{}\{3/2\}\$ magnetic energy spectrum as predicted by Kazantsev dynamo theory. In these feedback-dominated galaxies, stellar feedback provides forcing on large scales close to the halo scale radius, providing thus exponential field growth on all scales within the galaxy. We also investigate simulations with a final quiescent phase by manually turning off the feedback. As turbulence decreases, the galactic fountain settles into a thin, rotationally supported disk. The magnetic field develops a large-scale, well-ordered structure with quadrupole symmetry, irrespective of the initial field topology, which is in good agreement with magnetic field observations of nearby spirals. Our findings suggest that weak initial seed fields were first amplified by a small-scale dynamo during a violent, feedback-dominated early phase in the galaxy formation history, followed by a more quiescent evolution, where the fields have slowly decayed or were maintained via large-scale dynamo action.},

Analog compression that narrows down the input bandwidth prior to sampling with commercial devices. A nonlinear algorithm then detects the input subspace prior to conventional signal processing. A representative union model of spectrally-sparse signals serves as a test-case to study these Xampling functions. We adopt three metrics for the choice of analog compression: robustness to model mismatch, required hardware accuracy and software complexities. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between two sub-Nyquist acquisition strategies for spectrally-sparse signals, the random demodulator and the modulated wideband converter (MWC), in terms of these metrics and draw operative conclusions regarding the choice of analog compression. We then address lowrate signal processing and develop an algorithm for that purpose that enables convenient signal processing at sub-Nyquist rates from samples obtained by the MWC. We conclude by showing that a variety of other sampling approaches for different union classes fit nicely into our framework.},

In order to save communication power, the optimal number of clusters is derived and the idea of groupwise constrained clustering is introduced to minimize intra-cluster distance under spectrum-aware constraint. In terms of practical implementation, DSAC demonstrates preferable scalability and stability because of its low complexity and quick convergence under dynamic PU activity.

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of two technologies that have been put forward for the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks, namely, network-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communications and massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output). Potential benefits of both technologies are known individually, but the tradeoffs resulting from their coexistence have not been adequately addressed. To this end, we assume that D2D users reuse the downlink resources of cellular networks in an underlay fashion. In addition, multiple antennas at the BS are used in order to obtain precoding gains and simultaneously support multiple cellular users using multiuser or massive MIMO technique. Two metrics are considered, namely the average sum rate (ASR) and energy efficiency (EE). We derive tractable and directly computable expressions and study the tradeoffs between the ASR and EE as functions of the number of BS antennas, the number of cellular users and the density of D2D users within a given coverage area. Our results show that both the ASR and EE behave differently in scenarios with low and high density of D2D users, and that coexistence of underlay D2D communications and massive MIMO is mainly beneficial in low densities of D2D users.},

abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of approximate 2nd-order optimization method, where the Fisher information matrix used to compute the natural gradient direction can be viewed as an approximation of the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for how to design a practical and robust version of the method. Among our various other contributions is a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of natural gradient descent and more general stochastic methods, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by the method, which we show still holds for certain other choices of the curvature matrix, but notably not the Hessian.},

abstract = {In light of the ever-increasing demand for new spectral bands and the underutilization of those already allocated, the concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged. Opportunistic users could exploit temporarily vacant bands after detecting the absence of activity of their owners. One of the crucial tasks in the CR cycle is therefore spectrum sensing and detection which has to be precise and efficient. Yet, CRs typically deal with wideband signals whose Nyquist rates are very high. In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the power spectrum of such signals from sub-Nyquist samples, rather than the signal itself as done in previous work, in order to perform detection. We consider both sparse and non sparse signals as well as blind and non blind detection in the sparse case. For each one of those scenarii, we derive the minimal sampling rate allowing perfect reconstruction of the signal's power spectrum in a noise-free environment and provide power spectrum recovery techniques that achieve those rates. The analysis is performed for two different signal models considered in the literature, which we refer to as the analog and digital models, and shows that both lead to similar results. Simulations demonstrate power spectrum recovery at the minimal rate in noise-free settings and show the impact of several parameters on the detector performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensing time and sampling rate.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a framework for efficiently capturing signals that are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis. While often motivated as an alternative to Nyquist-rate sampling, there remains a gap between the discrete, finite-dimensional CS framework and the problem of acquiring a continuous-time signal. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploiting the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's), a collection of functions that trace back to the seminal work by Slepian, Landau, and Pollack on the effects of time-limiting and bandlimiting operations. DPSS's form a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating and merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse approximations for most sampled multiband signals. This multiband modulated DPSS dictionary can be readily incorporated into the CS framework. We provide theoretical guarantees and practical insight into the use of this dictionary for recovery of sampled multiband signals from compressive measurements.},

Examples of these universally optimal codes include Hamming, Golay, and Reed-Solomon codes, among many others, and this helps explain their robustness as the channel model varies. Universal optimality of these codes is equivalent to minimality of their binomial moments, which has been proved in many cases by Ashikhmin and Barg. We highlight connections with mathematical physics and the analogy between these results and previous work by Cohn and Kumar in the continuous setting, and we develop a framework for optimizing the linear programming bounds. Furthermore, we show that if these bounds prove a code is universally optimal, then the code remains universally optimal even if one codeword is removed.},

Between these two phases, we identify a spin liquid region characterized by the exponential decaying spin and dimer correlations, as well as the large spin singlet and triplet excitation gaps on finite-size systems. We find two near degenerating ground states with distinct properties in two sectors, which indicates more than one spin liquid candidates in this region. While the sector with spinon is found to respect the time reversal symmetry, the even sector without a spinon breaks such a symmetry for finite-size systems. Furthermore, we detect the signature of the fractionalization by following the evolution of different ground states with inserting spin flux into the cylinder system. Moreover, by tuning the anisotropic bond coupling, we explore the nature of the spin liquid phase and find the optimal parameter region for the gapped \$Z\_2\$ spin liquid.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to characterize the best achievable performance for the problem of estimating an unknown parameter having a sparse representation. Specifically, we consider the setting in which a sparsely representable deterministic parameter vector is to be estimated from measurements corrupted by Gaussian noise, and derive a lower bound on the mean-squared error (MSE) achievable in this setting. To this end, an appropriate definition of bias in the sparse setting is developed, and the constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is obtained. This bound is shown to equal the CRB of an estimator with knowledge of the support set, for almost all feasible parameter values. Consequently, in the unbiased case, our bound is identical to the MSE of the oracle estimator. Combined with the fact that the CRB is achieved at high signal-to-noise ratios by the maximum likelihood technique, our result provides a new interpretation for the common practice of using the oracle estimator as a gold standard against which practical approaches are compared.},

The quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative Hessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the original least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the statistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number of iterations. We illustrate our general theory with simulations for both unconstrained and constrained versions of least-squares, including \$\backslash ell\_1\$-regularization and nuclear norm constraints. We also numerically demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a real face expression classification experiment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of collaboratively estimating the sparsity pattern of a sparse signal with multiple measurement data in distributed networks. We assume that each node makes Compressive Sensing (CS) based measurements via random projections regarding the same sparse signal. We propose a distributed greedy algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in which the sparse support is estimated iteratively while fusing indices estimated at distributed nodes. In the proposed distributed framework, each node has to perform less number of iterations of OMP compared to the sparsity index of the sparse signal. Thus, with each node having a very small number of compressive measurements, a significant performance gain in support recovery is achieved via the proposed collaborative scheme compared to the case where each node estimates the sparsity pattern independently and then fusion is performed to get a global estimate. We further extend the algorithm to estimate the sparsity pattern in a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the algorithm first detects the presence of a sparse signal collaborating among nodes with a fewer number of iterations of OMP and then increases the number of iterations to estimate the sparsity pattern only if the signal is detected.},

abstract = {Overwhelming majority of econometric models applied on a long term basis in the financial forex market do not work sufficiently well. The reason is that transaction costs and arbitrage opportunity are not included, as this does not simulate the real financial markets. Analyses are not conducted on the non equidistant date but rather on the aggregate date, which is also not a real financial case. In this paper, we would like to show a new way how to analyze and, moreover, forecast financial market. We utilize the projections of the real exchange rate dynamics onto the string-like topology in the OANDA market. The latter approach allows us to build the stable prediction models in trading in the financial forex market. The real application of the multi-string structures is provided to demonstrate our ideas for the solution of the problem of the robust portfolio selection. The comparison with the trend following strategies was performed, the stability of the algorithm on the transaction costs for long trade periods was confirmed.},

abstract = {We consider a regularized least squares problem, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms, which extend the usual \$\backslash ell\_1\$ and the group lasso penalty, by allowing the subsets to overlap. Such regularizations lead to nonsmooth problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper a suitable version of an accelerated proximal method to solve them. We prove convergence of a nested procedure, obtained composing an accelerated proximal method with an inner algorithm for computing the proximity operator. By exploiting the geometrical properties of the penalty, we devise a new active set strategy, thanks to which the inner iteration is relatively fast, thus guaranteeing good computational performances of the overall algorithm. Our approach allows to deal with high dimensional problems without pre-processing for dimensionality reduction, leading to better computational and prediction performances with respect to the state-of-the art methods, as shown empirically both on toy and real data.},

In the first part of the paper, we derive our Bilinear G-AMP (BiG-AMP) algorithm as an approximation of the sum-product belief propagation algorithm in the high-dimensional limit, where central-limit theorem arguments and Taylor-series approximations apply, and under the assumption of statistically independent matrix entries with known priors. In addition, we propose an adaptive damping mechanism that aids convergence under finite problem sizes, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based method to automatically tune the parameters of the assumed priors, and two rank-selection strategies. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the specializations of EM-BiG-AMP to the problems of matrix completion, robust PCA, and dictionary learning, and present the results of an extensive empirical study comparing EM-BiG-AMP to state-of-the-art algorithms on each problem. Our numerical results, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that EM-BiG-AMP yields excellent reconstruction accuracy (often best in class) while maintaining competitive runtimes and avoiding the need to tune algorithmic parameters.},

Numerical examples demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithms using simulated and real data: Info-Greedy Sensing shows significant improvement over random projection for signals with sparse and low-rank covariance matrices, and adaptivity brings robustness when there is a mismatch between the assumed and the true distributions.},

abstract = {Quantum creation processes during the very rapid early expansion of the universe are believed to give rise to temperature anisotropies and polarization patterns in the CMB radiation. These have been observed by satellites such as COBE, WMAP, and PLANCK, and by bolometric instruments placed near the South Pole by the BICEP collaborations. The expected temperature anisotropies are well-confirmed. The B-mode polarization patterns in the CMB are currently under measurement jointly by the PLANCK and BICEP groups to determine the extent to which the B-modes can be attributed to gravitational waves from the creation of gravitons in the earliest universe. It was during 1962 that I proved that quanta of the minimally-coupled scalar field were created by the general expanding FLRW universe. This was relevant also to the creation of quantized perturbations of the gravitational field, since these perturbations satisfied linear field equations that could be quantized in the same way as the minimally-coupled scalar field equation. In fact, in 1946, E.M. Lifshitz had considered the classical Einstein gravitational field in FLRW expanding universes and had shown that the classical linearized Einstein field equations reduced, in what is now known as the Lifshitz gauge, to two separate classical minimally-coupled massless scalar field equations. These field equations of Lifshitz, when quantized, correspond to the field equations for massless gravitons, one equation for each of the two independent polarization components of the spin-2 massless graviton. I will discuss this further in this article.1 1 Plenary Lecture given September 2, 2014 at the ERE2014 Conference in Valencia, Spain},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop efficient decoders for non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We apply ADMM to two decoding problems. The first problem is linear programming (LP) decoding. In order to develop an efficient algorithm, we focus on non-binary codes in fields of characteristic two. This allows us to transform each constraint in \$\backslash mathbb\{F\}\_\{2\^{}m\}\$ to a set of constraints in \$\backslash mathbb\{F\}\_\{2\}\$ that has a factor graph representation. Applying ADMM to the LP decoding problem results in two types of non-trivial sub-routines. The first type requires us to solve an unconstrained quadratic program. We solve this problem efficiently by leveraging new results obtained from studying the above factor graphs. The second type requires Euclidean projection onto polytopes that are studied in the literature, a projection that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf techniques, which scale linearly in the dimension of the vector to project. ADMM LP decoding scales linearly with block length, linearly with check degree, and quadratically with field size. The second problem we consider is a penalized LP decoding problem. This problem is obtained by incorporating a penalty term into the LP decoding objective. The purpose of the penalty term is to make non-integer solutions (pseudocodewords) more expensive and hence to improve decoding performance. The ADMM algorithm for the penalized LP problem requires Euclidean projection onto a polytope formed by embedding the constraints specified by the non-binary single parity-check code, which can be solved by applying the ADMM technique to the resulting quadratic program. Empirically, this decoder achieves a much reduced error rate than LP decoding at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design an efficient and convergent alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for finding a solution of medium accuracy to conic programming problems whose constraints consist of linear equalities, linear inequalities, a non-polyhedral cone and a polyhedral cone. For this class of problems, one may apply the directly extended ADMM to their dual, which can be written in the form of convex programming with four separable blocks in the objective function and a coupling linear equation constraint. Indeed, the directly extended ADMM, though may diverge in theory, often performs much better numerically than many of its variants with theoretical convergence guarantee. Ideally, one should find a convergent variant which is at least as efficient as the directly extended ADMM in practice. We achieve this goal by designing a convergent semi-proximal ADMM (called sPADMM3c for convenience) for convex programming problems having three separable blocks in the objective function with the third part being linear. At each iteration, the proposed sPADMM3c takes one special block coordinate descent (BCD) cycle with the order \$1 \backslash rightarrow 3 \backslash rightarrow 2 \backslash rightarrow 3\$, instead of the usual \$1 \backslash rightarrow 2 \backslash rightarrow 3\$ Gauss-Seidel BCD cycle used in the non-convergent directly extended \$3\$-block ADMM, for updating the variable blocks. Our extensive numerical tests on the important class of doubly non-negative semidefinite programming (SDP) problems with linear equality and/or inequality constraints demonstrate that our convergent method is at least \$20\%\$ faster than the directly extended ADMM with unit step-length for the vast majority of about \$550\$ large scale problems tested.},

abstract = {We study the scalability of consensus-based distributed optimization algorithms by considering two questions: How many processors should we use for a given problem, and how often should they communicate when communication is not free? Central to our analysis is a problem-specific value \$r\$ which quantifies the communication/computation tradeoff. We show that organizing the communication among nodes as a \$k\$-regular expander graph (Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson, 2002) yields speedups, while when all pairs of nodes communicate (as in a complete graph), there is an optimal number of processors that depends on \$r\$. Surprisingly, a speedup can be obtained, in terms of the time to reach a fixed level of accuracy, by communicating less and less frequently as the computation progresses. Experiments on a real cluster solving metric learning and non-smooth convex minimization tasks demonstrate strong agreement between theory and practice.},

abstract = {This paper considers a network in which a primary user (PU) may cooperate with a cognitive radio (CR) user for transmission of its data packets. The PU is assumed to be a buffered terminal operating in a time-slotted fashion. We develop two protocols which involve cooperation between primary and secondary users. To satisfy certain quality of service requirements, users share time slot duration and frequency bandwidth. Moreover, the secondary user (SU) may leverage the primary feedback signal. The proposed protocols are designed such that the secondary rate is maximized and the primary queueing delay is maintained less than the queueing delay in case of non-cooperative PU. In addition, the proposed protocols guarantee the stability of the primary queue and maintain the average energy emitted by the CR user below a certain value. The proposed protocols also provide more robust and potentially continuous service for SUs compared to the conventional practice in cognitive networks where SUs transmit in the spectrum holes and silence sessions of the PUs. We include primary source burstiness, sensing errors, and feedback reception errors to the analysis of the proposed cooperative cognitive protocols. Numerical results show the beneficial gains of the cooperative protocols in terms of secondary rate and primary throughput, queueing delay, and average energy savings.},

abstract = {We study "random surfaces," which are random real (or integer) valued functions on Z\^{}d. The laws are determined by convex, nearest neighbor, difference potentials that are invariant under translation by a full-rank sublattice L of Z\^{}d; they include many discrete and continuous height models (e.g., domino tilings, square ice, the harmonic crystal, the Ginzburg-Landau grad-phi interface model, the linear solid-on-solid model) as special cases.   A gradient phase is an L-ergodic gradient Gibbs measure with finite specific free energy. A gradient phase is smooth if it is the gradient of an ordinary Gibbs measure; otherwise it is rough. We prove a variational principle--characterizing gradient phases of a given slope as minimizers of the specific free energy--and an empirical measure large deviations principle (with a unique rate function minimizer) for random surfaces on mesh approximations of bounded domains.   Using a geometric technique called "cluster swapping" (a variant of the Swendsen-Wang update for Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters), we also prove that the surface tension is strictly convex and that if u is in the interior of the space of finite-surface tension slopes, then there exists a minimal energy gradient phase mu\_u of slope u. This mu\_u is always unique for real valued random surfaces.   In the discrete models, mu\_u is unique if at least one of the following holds: d is in \{1, 2\}, there exists a rough gradient phase of slope u, or u is irrational. When d=2, the slopes of all smooth phases (a.k.a. crystal facets) lie in the dual lattice of L.},

In the third chapter, applications of the method to e.g. Gaussian free fields and issues of percolation in high dimensions are briefly touched upon.

Consider a Brownian motion conditioned on the event \$\backslash mathcal\{E\}\$ -- that its local time is bounded everywhere by 1. This event has probability zero and so must be approximated by events of positive probability. We prove that several natural quantities, in particular the speed of the process, are highly sensitive to the approximation procedure, and hence are not universal. However, we also propose an exponent \$\backslash kappa\$ -- which measures the strength of the entropic repulsion by evaluating the probability that a particular point comes close to violating the condition \$\backslash mathcal\{E\}\$. We show that \$\backslash kappa=3\$ for several natural approximations of \$\backslash mathcal\{E\}\$, and conjecture that \$\backslash kappa=3\$ is universal in a sense that we make precise.},

Random forests achieve competitive predictive performance and are computationally efficient to train and test, making them excellent candidates for real-world prediction tasks. The most popular random forest variants (such as Breiman's random forest and extremely randomized trees) operate on batches of training data. Online methods are now in greater demand. Existing online random forests, however, require more training data than their batch counterpart to achieve comparable predictive performance. In this work, we use Mondrian processes (Roy and Teh, 2009) to construct ensembles of random decision trees we call Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests can be grown in an incremental/online fashion and remarkably, the distribution of online Mondrian forests is the same as that of batch Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests achieve competitive predictive performance comparable with existing online random forests and periodically re-trained batch random forests, while being more than an order of magnitude faster, thus representing a better computation vs accuracy tradeoff.},

For balanced allocations, keys are hashed into a hash table where each bucket can hold multiple keys, and each key is placed in the least loaded of \$d\$ choices. It has been shown previously that asymptotically the performance of double hashing and fully random hashing is the same in the balanced allocation paradigm using fluid limit methods. Here we extend a coupling argument used by Lueker and Molodowitch to show that double hashing and ideal uniform hashing are asymptotically equivalent in the setting of open address hash tables to the balanced allocation setting, providing further insight into this phenomenon. We also discuss the potential for and bottlenecks limiting the use this approach for other multiple choice hashing schemes.},

abstract = {This paper studies the fundamental limits of the minimum average length of lossless and lossy variable-length compression, allowing a nonzero error probability \$\backslash epsilon\$, for lossless compression. We give non-asymptotic bounds on the minimum average length in terms of Erokhin's rate-distortion function and we use those bounds to obtain a Gaussian approximation on the speed of approach to the limit which is quite accurate for all but small blocklengths: \$\$(1 - $\backslash$epsilon) k H($\backslash$mathsf S) - $\backslash$sqrt\{$\backslash$frac\{k V($\backslash$mathsf S)\}\{2 $\backslash$pi\} \} e\^{}\{- $\backslash$frac \{(Q\^{}\{-1\}($\backslash$epsilon))\^{}2\} 2 \}\$\$ where \$Q\^{}\{-1\}(\backslash cdot)\$ is the functional inverse of the standard Gaussian complementary cdf, and \$V(\backslash mathsf S)\$ is the source dispersion. A nonzero error probability thus not only reduces the asymptotically achievable rate by a factor of \$1 - \backslash epsilon\$, but this asymptotic limit is approached from below, i.e. larger source dispersions and shorter blocklengths are beneficial. Variable-length lossy compression under an excess distortion constraint is shown to exhibit similar properties.},

We give a precise characterization of the effect of this hierarchy constraint, prove that hierarchy holds with probability one and derive an unbiased estimate for the degrees of freedom of our estimator. A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity-the number of nonzero coefficients-and practical sparsity-the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort. We develop an algorithm, available in the R package hierNet, and perform an empirical study of our method.},

abstract = {The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is the most efficiently known way to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an arbitrary n-length signal, and has a computational complexity of O(n log n). If the DFT X of the signal x has only k non-zero coefficients (where k < n), can we do better? In [1], we addressed this question and presented a novel FFAST (Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse Transform) algorithm that cleverly induces sparse graph alias codes in the DFT domain, via a Chinese-Remainder-Theorem (CRT)-guided sub-sampling operation of the time-domain samples. The resulting sparse graph alias codes are then exploited to devise a fast and iterative onion-peeling style decoder that computes an n length DFT of a signal using only O(k) time-domain samples and O(klog k) computations. The FFAST algorithm is applicable whenever k is sub-linear in n (i.e. k = o(n)), but is obviously most attractive when k is much smaller than n.   In this paper, we adapt the FFAST framework of [1] to the case where the time-domain samples are corrupted by a white Gaussian noise. In particular, we show that the extended noise robust algorithm R-FFAST computes an n-length k-sparse DFT X using O(klog \^{}3 n) noise-corrupted time-domain samples, in O(klog\^{}4n) computations, i.e., sub-linear time complexity. While our theoretical results are for signals with a uniformly random support of the non-zero DFT coefficients and additive white Gaussian noise, we provide simulation results which demonstrates that the R-FFAST algorithm performs well even for signals like MR images, that have an approximately sparse Fourier spectrum with a non-uniform support for the dominant DFT coefficients.},

abstract = {A sensor network is considered where at each sensor a sequence of random variables is observed. At each time step, a processed version of the observations is transmitted from the sensors to a common node called the fusion center. At some unknown point in time the distribution of observations at an unknown subset of the sensor nodes changes. The objective is to detect the outlying sequences as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on the false alarm rate, the cost of observations taken at each sensor, and the cost of communication between the sensors and the fusion center. Minimax formulations are proposed for the above problem and algorithms are proposed that are shown to be asymptotically optimal for the proposed formulations, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. It is also shown, via numerical studies, that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than those based on fractional sampling, in which the classical algorithms from the literature are used and the constraint on the cost of observations is met by using the outcome of a sequence of biased coin tosses, independent of the observation process.},

abstract = {This article re-examines the fundamental notion of interference in wireless networks by contrasting traditional approaches to new concepts that handle interference in a creative way. Specifically, we discuss the fundamental limits of the interference channel and present the interference alignment technique and its extension of signal alignment techniques. Contrary to this traditional view, which treats interference as a detrimental phenomenon, we introduce three concepts that handle interference as a useful resource. The first concept exploits interference at the modulation level and leads to simple multiuser downlink precoding that provides significant energy savings. The second concept uses radio frequency radiation for energy harvesting and handles interference as a source of green energy. The last concept refers to a secrecy environment and uses interference as an efficient means to jam potential eavesdroppers. These three techniques bring a new vision about interference in wireless networks and motivate a plethora of potential new applications and services.},

Our contribution is a generalised model of BIA in a heterogeneous network with one macrocell with K users and K femtocells each with one user, by using Kronecker (Tensor) Product representation.

In this model, a fixed string of \$n\$ symbols is given and one \$\backslash delta\$-bit symbol arrives at a time in a stream. After each symbol arrives, the distance between the fixed string and a suffix of most recent symbols of the stream is reported. The cell-probe model is perhaps the strongest model of computation for showing data structure lower bounds, subsuming in particular the popular word-RAM model.   * We first give an \$\backslash Omega((\backslash delta \backslash log n)/(w+\backslash log\backslash log n))\$ lower bound for the time to give each output for both online Hamming distance and convolution, where \$w\$ is the word size. This bound relies on a new encoding scheme and for the first time holds even when \$w\$ is as small as a single bit.   * We then consider the online edit distance and longest common subsequence problems in the bit-probe model (\$w=1\$) with a constant sized input alphabet. We give a lower bound of \$\backslash Omega(\backslash sqrt\{\backslash log n\}/(\backslash log\backslash log n)\^{}\{3/2\})\$ which applies for both problems. This second set of results relies both on our new encoding scheme as well as a carefully constructed hard distribution.   * Finally, for the online edit distance problem we show that there is an \$O((\backslash log n)\^{}2/w)\$ upper bound in the cell-probe model. This bound gives a contrast to our new lower bound and also establishes an exponential gap between the known cell-probe and RAM model complexities.},

abstract = {Quickest change point detection is concerned with the detection of statistical change(s) in sequences while minimizing the detection delay subject to false alarm constraints. In this paper, the problem of change point detection is studied when the decision maker only has access to compressive measurements. First, an expression for the average detection delay of Shiryaev's procedure with compressive measurements is derived in the asymptotic regime where the probability of false alarm goes to zero. Second, the dependence of the delay on the compression ratio and the signal to noise ratio is explicitly quantified. The ratio of delays with and without compression is studied under various sensing matrix constructions, including Gaussian ensembles and random projections. For a target ratio of the delays after and before compression, a sufficient condition on the number of measurements required to meet this objective with prespecified probability is derived.},

abstract = {We use deep Swift UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) near-ultraviolet (1600A to 4000A) imaging of the Chandra Deep Field South to measure the rest-frame far-UV (FUV; 1500A) luminosity function (LF) in four redshift bins between z=0.2 and 1.2. Our sample includes 730 galaxies with u < 24.1 mag. We use two methods to construct and fit the LFs: the traditional V\_max method with bootstrap errors and a maximum likelihood estimator. We observe luminosity evolution such that M* fades by \~{}2 magnitudes from z\~{}1 to z\~{}0.3 implying that star formation activity was substantially higher at z\~{}1 than today. We integrate our LFs to determine the FUV luminosity densities and star formation rate densities from z=0.2 to 1.2. We find evolution consistent with an increase proportional to (1+z)\^{}1.9 out to z\~{}1. Our luminosity densities and star formation rates are consistent with those found in the literature, but are, on average, a factor of \~{}2 higher than previous FUV measurements. In addition, we combine our UVOT data with the MUSYC survey to model the galaxies' ultraviolet-to-infrared spectral energy distributions and estimate the rest-frame FUV attenuation. We find that accounting for the attenuation increases the star formation rate densities by \~{}1 dex across all four redshift bins.},

abstract = {Operator splitting schemes are a class of powerful algorithms that solve complicated monotone inclusion and convex optimization problems that are built from many simpler pieces. They give rise to algorithms in which all simple pieces of the decomposition are processed individually. This leads to easily implementable and highly parallelizable or distributed algorithms, which often obtain nearly state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of the forward-Douglas-Rachford splitting (FDRS) algorithm, which is a generalization of the forward-backward splitting (FBS) and Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) algorithms. Under general convexity assumptions, we derive the ergodic and nonergodic convergence rates of the FDRS algorithm, and show that these rates are the best possible. Under Lipschitz differentiability assumptions, we show that the best iterate of FDRS converges as quickly as the last iterate of the FBS algorithm. Under strong convexity assumptions, we derive convergence rates for a sequence that strongly converges to a minimizer. Under strong convexity and Lipschitz differentiability assumptions, we show that FDRS converges linearly. We also provide examples where the objective is strongly convex, yet FDRS converges arbitrarily slowly. Finally, we relate the FDRS algorithm to a primal-dual forward-backward splitting scheme and clarify its place among existing splitting methods. Our results show that the FDRS algorithm automatically adapts to the regularity of the objective functions and achieves rates that improve upon the sharp worst case rates that hold in the absence of smoothness and strong convexity.},

abstract = {We present a physical model for electronic switching in cantilever based nano-electro-mechanical field effect transistors, focusing on the steepness of its switching curve. We find that the subthreshold swing of the voltage transfer characteristic is governed by two separate considerations - the ability of the charges to correlate together through dipolar interactions and amplify the active torque, versus the active pull-in forces that drive an abrupt phase transition and close the air gap between the tip of the cantilever and the drain. For small sized relays, dipolar and short-range Van Der Waals 'sticking' forces dominate, while for longer cantilevers the capacitive energy acquires a major role. The individual pull-in and pull-out phases demonstrate a remarkably low subthreshold swing driven by the capacitive forces, sharpened further by dipolar correlation. The sharp switching, however, comes at the expense of strong hysteresis as the metastable and stable states interchange along the forward and reverse phases of the voltage scan.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the compressed sensing reconstruction problem with generalized elastic net prior (GENP), where a sparse signal is sampled via a noisy underdetermined linear observation system, and an additional initial estimation of the signal (the GENP) is available during the reconstruction. We first incorporate the GENP into the LASSO and the approximate message passing (AMP) frameworks, denoted by GENP-LASSO and GENP-AMP respectively. We then investigate the parameter selection, state evolution, and noise-sensitivity analysis of GENP-AMP. We show that, thanks to the GENP, there is no phase transition boundary in the proposed frameworks, i.e., the reconstruction error is bounded in the entire plane. The error is also smaller than those of the standard AMP and scalar denoising. A practical parameterless version of the GENP-AMP is also developed, which does not need to know the sparsity of the unknown signal and the variance of the GENP. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed schemes.},

I will discuss the recent observation of TeV to PeV neutrinos by the IceCube Cherenkov telescope in the context of gamma-ray astronomy. The corresponding energy range of hadronic gamma-rays is not directly accessible by extragalactic gamma-ray astronomy due to interactions with cosmic radiation backgrounds. Nevertheless, the isotropic sub-TeV gamma-ray background observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) contains indirect information from secondary emission produced in electromagnetic cascades and constrains hadronic emission scenarios. On the other hand, observation of PeV gamma-rays would provide a smoking-gun signal for Galactic emission. In general, the cross-correlation of neutrino emission with (extended) Galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources will serve as the most sensitive probe for a future identification of neutrino sources.},

abstract = {For testing independence it is very popular to use either the \$\backslash chi\^{}\{2\}\$-statistic or \$G\^{}\{2\}\$-statistics (mutual information). Asymptotically both are \$\backslash chi\^{}\{2\}\$-distributed so an obvious question is which of the two statistics that has a distribution that is closest to the \$\backslash chi\^{}\{2\}\$-distribution. Surprisingly the distribution of mutual information is much better approximated by a \$\backslash chi\^{}\{2\}\$-distribution than the \$\backslash chi\^{}\{2\}\$-statistic. For technical reasons we shall focus on the simplest case with one degree of freedom. We introduce the signed log-likelihood and demonstrate that its distribution function can be related to the distribution function of a standard Gaussian by inequalities. For the hypergeometric distribution we formulate a general conjecture about how close the signed log-likelihood is to a standard Gaussian, and this conjecture gives much more accurate estimates of the tail probabilities of this type of distribution than previously published results. The conjecture has been proved numerically in all cases relevant for testing independence and further evidence of its validity is given.},

abstract = {Consider a linear space of functions on the binary hypercube and a linear operator \$T\_\backslash delta\$ acting by averaging a function over a Hamming sphere of radius \$\backslash delta n\$. It is shown that such an operator has a dimension independent bound on the norm \$L\_p \backslash to L\_2\$ with \$p = 1+(1-2\backslash delta)\^{}2\$. This result evidently parallels a classical estimate of Bonami and Gross for \$L\_p \backslash to L\_q\$ norms for the operator of convolution with a Bernoulli noise. The estimate for \$T\_\backslash delta\$ is harder to obtain since the latter is neither a part of a semigroup, nor a tensor power. The result is shown by a detailed study of the eigenvalues of \$T\_\backslash delta\$ and \$L\_p\backslash to L\_2\$ norms of the Fourier multiplier operators \$\backslash Pi\_a\$ with symbol equal to a characterstic function of the Hamming sphere of radius \$a\$.   An application of the result to additive combinatorics is given: Any set \$A\backslash subset \backslash FF\_2\^{}n\$ with the property that \$A+A\$ contains a large portion of some Hamming sphere (counted with multiplicity) must have cardinality a constant multiple of \$2\^{}n\$.

abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) is on recovery of high dimensional signals from their low dimensional linear measurements under a sparsity prior and digital quantization of the measurement data is inevitable in practical implementation of CS algorithms. In the existing literature, the quantization error is modeled typically as additive noise and the multi-bit and 1-bit quantized CS problems are dealt with separately using different treatments and procedures. In this paper, a novel variational Bayesian inference based CS algorithm is presented, which unifies the multi- and 1-bit CS processing and is applicable to various cases of noiseless/noisy environment and unsaturated/saturated quantizer. By decoupling the quantization error from the measurement noise, the quantization error is modeled as a random variable and estimated jointly with the signal being recovered. Such a novel characterization of the quantization error results in superior performance of the algorithm which is demonstrated by extensive simulations in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for both multi-bit and 1-bit CS problems.},

abstract = {This paper considers large random wireless networks where transmit-and-receive node pairs communicate within a certain range while sharing a common spectrum. By modeling the spatial locations of nodes based on stochastic geometry, analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency of a typical node pair are derived as a function of the channel state information available at a receiver (CSIR) in terms of relevant system parameters: the density of communication links, the number of receive antennas, the path loss exponent, and the operating signal-to-noise ratio. One key finding is that when the receiver only exploits CSIR for the direct link, the sum of spectral efficiencies linearly improves as the density increases, when the number of receive antennas increases as a certain super-linear function of the density. When each receiver exploits CSIR for a set of dominant interfering links in addition to the direct link, the sum of spectral efficiencies linearly increases with both the density and the path loss exponent if the number of antennas is a linear function of the density. This observation demonstrates that having CSIR for dominant interfering links provides a multiplicative gain in the scaling law. It is also shown that this linear scaling holds for direct CSIR when incorporating the effect of the receive antenna correlation, provided that the rank of the spatial correlation matrix scales super-linearly with the density. Simulation results back scaling laws derived from stochastic geometry.},

It is shown that this new technique gives precise results at small depths (less than 100nm), even for films with a thickness lower than 500nm, which was not possible to achieve with the classical CSM method. However, experimental and numerical results obtained both with classical nanoindentation and second harmonic methods differ at high indentation depth.

This turns out to provide an elegant missing-data interpretation of the proximal gradient method, a widely used algorithm in machine learning. We show several statistical applications in which the proposed framework leads to easily implemented algorithms, including a robust version of the fused lasso, nonlinear quantile regression via trend filtering, and the binomial fused double Pareto model.

abstract = {Compressive sampling offers a new paradigm for acquiring signals that are compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. The major algorithmic challenge in compressive sampling is to approximate a compressible signal from noisy samples. This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems because it requires only matrix-vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For many cases of interest, the running time is just O(N*log\^{}2(N)), where N is the length of the signal.},

abstract = {We consider nonparametric or universal sequential hypothesis testing problem when the distribution under the null hypothesis is fully known but the alternate hypothesis corresponds to some other unknown distribution. These algorithms are primarily motivated from spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radios and intruder detection in wireless sensor networks. We use easily implementable universal lossless source codes to propose simple algorithms for such a setup. The algorithms are first proposed for discrete alphabet. Their performance and asymptotic properties are studied theoretically. Later these are extended to continuous alphabets. Their performance with two well known universal source codes, Lempel-Ziv code and Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator with Arithmetic Encoder are compared. These algorithms are also compared with the tests using various other nonparametric estimators. Finally a decentralized version utilizing spatial diversity is also proposed. Its performance is analysed and asymptotic properties are proved.},

This process results in large matrices to calculate with and a large number of coefficients to be stored. In our previous work we have developed an adaptively refining solution scheme that determines the indices, where refined basis functions are to be included, and later a method for predicting the next, finer resolution coefficients in a very economic way. In the present contribution we would like to determine, whether the method can be applied for predicting not only the first, but also the other, higher resolution level coefficients. Also the energy expectation values of the predicted wave functions are studied, as well as the scaling behaviour of the coefficients in the fine resolution limit.},

Using the thermal stability condition, we discuss the phase structures of various ensembles of this system formed in this way and find out the situations that the black brane could be the final stable phase in these ensembles.

abstract = {The emergence of an effective field theory out of equilibrium is studied in the case in which a light field --the system-- interacts with very heavy fields in a finite temperature bath. We obtain the reduced density matrix for the light field, its time evolution is determined by an effective action that includes the $\backslash$emph\{influence action\} from correlations of the heavy degrees of freedom. The non-equilibrium effective field theory yields a Langevin equation of motion for the light field in terms of dissipative and noise kernels that obey a generalized fluctuation dissipation relation. These are completely determined by the spectral density of the bath which is analyzed in detail for several cases. At \$T=0\$ we elucidate the effect of thresholds in the renormalization aspects and the asymptotic emergence of a local effective field theory with unitary time evolution. At \$T\backslash neq 0\$ new "anomalous" thresholds arise, in particular the $\backslash$emph\{decay\} of the environmental heavy fields into the light field leads to $\backslash$emph\{dissipative\} dynamics of the light field. Even when the heavy bath particles are thermally suppressed this dissipative contribution leads to the $\backslash$emph\{thermalization\} of the light field which is confirmed by a quantum kinetics analysis. We obtain the quantum master equation and show explicitly that its solution in the field basis is precisely the influence action that determines the effective non-equilibrium field theory. The Lindblad form of the quantum master equation features $\backslash$emph\{time dependent dissipative coefficients\}. Their time dependence is crucial to extract renormalization effects at asymptotically long time. The dynamics from the quantum master equation is in complete agreement with that of the effective action, Langevin dynamics and quantum kinetics, thus providing a unified framework to effective field theory out of equilibrium.},

We derive a computational efficient edge-based version of this ML convex relaxation class and we design a distributed algorithm that enables the sensor nodes to solve these edge-based convex programs locally by communicating only with their close neighbors. This algorithm relies on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), it converges to the centralized solution, it can run asynchronously, and it is computation error-resilient.

Normalised pattern matching plays a key role in fields as diverse as image processing and musical information processing where application specific transformations are often applied to the input. By considering the class of polynomial transformations of the input, we provide fast algorithms and the first lower bounds for both new and old problems. Given a pattern of length m and a longer text of length n where both are assumed to contain integer values only, we first show O(n log m) time algorithms for pattern matching under linear transformations even when wildcard symbols can occur in the input. We then show how to extend the technique to polynomial transformations of arbitrary degree. Next we consider the problem of finding the minimum Hamming distance under polynomial transformation. We show that, for any epsilon>0, there cannot exist an O(n m\^{}(1-epsilon)) time algorithm for additive and linear transformations conditional on the hardness of the classic 3SUM problem. Finally, we consider a version of the Hamming distance problem under additive transformations with a bound k on the maximum distance that need be reported. We give a deterministic O(nk log k) time solution which we then improve by careful use of randomisation to O(n sqrt(k log k) log n) time for sufficiently small k.

abstract = {This paper examines the problem of locating outlier columns in a large, otherwise low-rank, matrix. We propose a simple two-step adaptive sensing and inference approach and establish theoretical guarantees for its performance; our results show that accurate outlier identification is achievable using very few linear summaries of the original data matrix -- as few as the squared rank of the low-rank component plus the number of outliers, times constant and logarithmic factors. We demonstrate the performance of our approach experimentally in two stylized applications, one motivated by robust collaborative filtering tasks, and the other by saliency map estimation tasks arising in computer vision and automated surveillance, and also investigate extensions to settings where the data are noisy, or possibly incomplete.},

abstract = {Ar\{$\backslash$i\}kan's polar coding technique is based on the idea of synthesizing \$n\$ channels from the \$n\$ instances of the physical channel by a simple linear encoding transformation. Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular input to the encoder. For large \$n\$, the synthesized channels become either essentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much information as the original \$n\$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by transmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels. Unfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels is poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying physical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient to determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete memoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the other. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is directly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which are essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the performance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast channels. Finally we show that these conditions imply that the simple quantum polar coding scheme of Renes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050504 (2012)] requires entanglement assistance for general channels, but also show such assistance to be unnecessary in many cases of interest.},

abstract = {The ability of curved gratings as sectors of concentric circular gratings to couple linearly polarized light into focused surface plasmons is investigated by theory, simulation and experiment. Curved gratings, as sectors of concentric circular gratings with four different sector angles, are etched into a 30-nm thick gold layer on a glass coverslip and used to couple linearly-polarised free space light at nm into surface plasmons. The experimental and simulation results show that increasing the sector angle of the curved gratings decreases the lateral spotsize of the excited surface plasmons, resulting in focussing of surface plasmons which is analogous to the behaviour of classical optical lenses. We also show that two faced curved gratings, with their groove radius mismatched by half of the plasmon wavelength (asymmetric configuration), can couple linearly-polarised light into a single focal spot of concentrated surface plasmons with smaller depth of focus and higher intensity in comparison to single-sided curved gratings. The major advantage of these structures is the coupling of linearly-polarised light into focused surface plasmons with access to and control of the plasmon focal spot, which facilitates potential applications in sensing, detection and nonlinear plasmonics.},

In practice, the major development community stores change requests and related data using bug tracking systems such as Bugzilla. These data, together with the data stored in a versioning system, such as Concurrent Versioning Systems, are a valuable source of information to create descriptions and also can perform useful analyzes. In our earlier work, we proposed a novel statistical bipartite weighted graph-based approach to assessing the degree of fault-proneness of the change request and Change Request artifacts. With the motivation gained from this model, here we propose a novel strategy that estimates the degree of fault-proneness of a change request by assessing the impact of a change request artifact towards fault-proneness that considers the correlation between change requests artifact as another factor, which is in addition to our earlier strategy. The proposed model can be titled as Assessing the Fault Proneness Degree of Change Request Artifacts by estimating the impact of change requests correlation (DFP-CRC). As stated in our earlier model, the method DFP-CRC also makes use of information retrieval methods to identify the change request artifacts of the devised change request. And further evaluates the degree of fault-proneness of the Change Requests by estimating the correlation between change requests. The proposed method is evaluated by applying on concurrent versioning and Change request logs of the production level maintenance project.},

Our signals are assumed to be stationary and ergodic, but the input statistics are unknown; the goal is to provide reconstruction algorithms that are universal to the input statistics. We present a novel algorithm that combines: (i) the approximate message passing (AMP) CS reconstruction framework, which converts the matrix channel recovery problem into scalar channel denoising; (ii) a universal denoising scheme based on context quantization, which partitions the stationary ergodic signal denoising into independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsequence denoising; and (iii) a density estimation approach that approximates the probability distribution of an i.i.d. sequence by fitting a Gaussian mixture (GM) model. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we provide three contributions: (i) numerical results showing that state evolution holds for non-separable Bayesian sliding-window denoisers; (ii) a universal denoiser that does not require the input signal to be bounded; and (iii) we modify the GM learning algorithm, and extend it to an i.i.d. denoiser. Our universal CS recovery algorithm compares favorably with existing reconstruction algorithms in terms of both reconstruction quality and runtime, despite not knowing the input statistics of the stationary ergodic signal.},

We desire a large class of sensing matrices which allow the user to discern important properties of the measured sparse signal. Of particular interest are matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP). RIP matrices are known to enable efficient and stable reconstruction of sufficiently sparse signals, but the deterministic construction of such matrices has proven very difficult. In this thesis, we discuss this matrix design problem in the context of a growing field of study known as frame theory. In the first two chapters, we build large families of equiangular tight frames and full spark frames, and we discuss their relationship to RIP matrices as well as their utility in other aspects of sparse signal processing. In Chapter 3, we pave the road to deterministic RIP matrices, evaluating various techniques to demonstrate RIP, and making interesting connections with graph theory and number theory. We conclude in Chapter 4 with a coherence-based alternative to RIP, which provides near-optimal probabilistic guarantees for various aspects of sparse signal processing while at the same time admitting a whole host of deterministic constructions.},

The error entropy consistency, which requires the error entropy of the learned function to approximate the minimum error entropy, is shown to be always true if the bandwidth parameter tends to 0 at an appropriate rate. The regression consistency, which requires the learned function to approximate the regression function, however, is a complicated issue. We prove that the error entropy consistency implies the regression consistency for homoskedastic models where the noise is independent of the input variable. But for heteroskedastic models, a counterexample is used to show that the two types of consistency do not coincide. A surprising result is that the regression consistency is always true, provided that the bandwidth parameter tends to infinity at an appropriate rate. Regression consistency of two classes of special models is shown to hold with fixed bandwidth parameter, which further illustrates the complexity of regression consistency of MEE. Fourier transform plays crucial roles in our analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) that uses convex analysis to simulate efficiently from high-dimensional densities that are log-concave, a class of probability distributions that is widely used in modern high-dimensional statistics and data analysis. The method is based on a new first-order approximation for Langevin diffusions that exploits log-concavity to construct Markov chains with favourable convergence properties. This approximation is closely related to Moreau-Yoshida regularisations for convex functions and uses proximity mappings instead of gradient mappings to approximate the continuous-time process. The proposed method complements existing MALA methods in two ways. First, the method is shown to have very robust stability properties and to converge geometrically for many target densities for which other MALA are not geometric, or only if the step size is sufficiently small. Second, the method can be applied to high-dimensional target densities that are not continuously differentiable, a class of distributions that is increasingly used in image processing and machine learning and that is beyond the scope of existing MALA and HMC algorithms. To use this method it is necessary to compute or to approximate efficiently the proximity mappings of the logarithm of the target density. For several popular models, including many Bayesian models used in modern signal and image processing and machine learning, this can be achieved with convex optimisation algorithms and with approximations based on proximal splitting techniques, which can be implemented in parallel. The proposed method is demonstrated on two challenging high-dimensional and non-differentiable models related to image resolution enhancement and low-rank matrix estimation that are not well addressed by existing MCMC methodology.},

abstract = {We analyze the convergence rate of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing the sum of two or more nonsmooth convex separable functions subject to linear constraints. Previous analysis of the ADMM typically assumes that the objective function is the sum of only two convex functions defined on two separable blocks of variables even though the algorithm works well in numerical experiments for three or more blocks. Moreover, there has been no rate of convergence analysis for the ADMM without strong convexity in the objective function. In this paper we establish the global linear convergence of the ADMM for minimizing the sum of any number of convex separable functions. This result settles a key question regarding the convergence of the ADMM when the number of blocks is more than two or if the strong convexity is absent. It also implies the linear convergence of the ADMM for several contemporary applications including LASSO, Group LASSO and Sparse Group LASSO without any strong convexity assumption. Our proof is based on estimating the distance from a dual feasible solution to the optimal dual solution set by the norm of a certain proximal residual, and by requiring the dual stepsize to be sufficiently small.},

abstract = {The \{$\backslash$em square\} \$G\^{}2\$ of a graph \$G\$ is the graph with the same vertex set as \$G\$ and with two vertices adjacent if their distance in \$G\$ is at most 2. Thomassen showed that every planar graph \$G\$ with maximum degree \$\backslash Delta(G)=3\$ satisfies \$\backslash chi(G\^{}2)\backslash leq 7\$. Kostochka and Woodall conjectured that for every graph, the list-chromatic number of \$G\^{}2\$ equals the chromatic number of \$G\^{}2\$, that is \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2)=\backslash chi(G\^{}2)\$ for all \$G\$. If true, this conjecture (together with Thomassen's result) implies that every planar graph \$G\$ with \$\backslash Delta(G)=3\$ satisfies \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2)\backslash leq 7\$. We prove that every connected graph (not necessarily planar) with \$\backslash Delta(G)=3\$ other than the Petersen graph satisfies \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2)\backslash leq 8\$ (and this is best possible). In addition, we show that if \$G\$ is a planar graph with \$\backslash Delta(G)=3\$ and girth \$g(G)\backslash geq 7\$, then \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2)\backslash leq 7\$. Dvo$\backslash$v\{r\}$\backslash$'ak, $\backslash$v\{S\}krekovski, and Tancer showed that if \$G\$ is a planar graph with \$\backslash Delta(G) = 3\$ and girth \$g(G) \backslash geq 10\$, then \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2)\backslash leq 6\$. We improve the girth bound to show that if \$G\$ is a planar graph with \$\backslash Delta(G)=3\$ and \$g(G) \backslash geq 9\$, then \$\backslash chi\_l(G\^{}2) \backslash leq 6\$. All of our proofs can be easily translated into linear-time coloring algorithms.},

abstract = {The friendship paradox refers to the sociological observation that, while the people's assessment of their own popularity is typically self-aggrandizing, in reality they are less popular than their friends. The generalized friendship paradox is the average alter superiority observed empirically in social settings, scientific collaboration networks, as well as online social media. We posit a quality-based network growth model in which the chance for a node to receive new links depends both on its degree and a quality parameter. Nodes are assigned qualities the first time they join the network, and these do not change over time. We analyse the model theoretically, finding expressions for the joint degree-quality distribution and nearest-neighbor distribution. We then demonstrate that this model exhibits both the friendship paradox and the generalized friendship paradox at the network level, regardless of the distribution of qualities. We also show that, in the proposed model, the degree and quality of each node are positively correlated regardless of how node qualities are distributed.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

abstract = {In the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, data are often informative, relative to the prior, only on a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Significant computational savings can be achieved by using this subspace to characterize and approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters. We first investigate approximation of the posterior covariance matrix as a low-rank update of the prior covariance matrix. We prove optimality of a particular update, based on the leading eigendirections of the matrix pencil defined by the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood and the prior precision, for a broad class of loss functions. This class includes the F$\backslash$"\{o\}rstner metric for symmetric positive definite matrices, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated distributions. We also propose two fast approximations of the posterior mean and prove their optimality with respect to a weighted Bayes risk under squared-error loss. These approximations are deployed in an offline-online manner, where a more costly but data-independent offline calculation is followed by fast online evaluations. As a result, these approximations are particularly useful when repeated posterior mean evaluations are required for multiple data sets. We demonstrate our theoretical results with several numerical examples, including high-dimensional X-ray tomography and an inverse heat conduction problem. In both of these examples, the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the inference problem can be exploited while producing results that are essentially indistinguishable from solutions computed in the full space.},

abstract = {Cluster formation is a fundamental aspect of the equation of state (EOS) of warm and dense nuclear matter such as can be found in supernovae (SNe). Similar matter can be studied in heavy-ion collisions (HIC). We use the experimental data of Qin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 172701 (2012)] to test calculations of cluster formation and the role of in-medium modifications of cluster properties in SN EOSs. For the comparison between theory and experiment we use chemical equilibrium constants as the main observables. This reduces some of the systematic uncertainties and allows deviations from ideal gas behavior to be identified clearly. In the analysis, we carefully account for the differences between matter in SNe and HICs. We find that, at the lowest densities, the experiment and all theoretical models are consistent with the ideal gas behavior. At higher densities ideal behavior is clearly ruled out and interaction effects have to be considered. The contributions of continuum correlations are of relevance in the virial expansion and remain a difficult problem to solve at higher densities. We conclude that at the densities and temperatures discussed mean-field interactions of nucleons, inclusion of all relevant light clusters, and a suppression mechanism of clusters at high densities have to be incorporated in the SN EOS.},

The number of tunneling counts is proportional to that of the random-walk REM multiplied by the square root of moving distance in temperature space. We applied this new implementation to two kinds of REM and compared the results with those of the conventional random-walk REM. The test system was a two-dimensional Ising model, and our new method reproduced the results of the conventional random-walk REM and improved the tunneling counts by three times or more than that of the random-walk REM.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for the application of support vector machine (SVM) learning to image compression. The algorithm combines SVMs with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Unlike a classic radial basis function networks or multilayer perceptrons that require the topology of the network to be defined before training, an SVM selects the minimum number of training points, called support vectors, that ensure modeling of the data within the given level of accuracy (a.k.a. insensitivity zone /spl epsi/). It is this property that is exploited as the basis for an image compression algorithm. Here, the SVMs learning algorithm performs the compression in a spectral domain of DCT coefficients, i.e., the SVM approximates the DCT coefficients. The parameters of the SVM are stored in order to recover the image. Results demonstrate that even though there is an extra lossy step compared with the baseline JPEG algorithm, the new algorithm dramatically increases compression for a given image quality; conversely it increases image quality for a given compression ratio. The approach presented can be readily applied for other modeling schemes that are in a form of a sum of weighted basis functions.},

An efficient algorithm for recovery of a sparse input from the STFT magnitude is then suggested, based on an adaptation of the recently proposed GESPAR algorithm.

This sparse, high-sensitivity survey (\$\backslash Delta Ta \backslash approx \backslash Delta Tmb \backslash approx 3.0 - 3.5\$ mK rms in 0.55 km/s channels), was carried out as a pilot project with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT, FWHM \$\backslash approx 7.6'\$) on a 3 X 9 grid at \$0.5\backslash deg\$ spacing. The pointings chosen correspond with those of the existing \$\^{}\{12\}\$CO(1-0) CfA survey of the Galaxy (FWHM \$\backslash approx 8.4'\$). With 2-hr integrations, 1667 MHz OH emission was detected with the GBT at \$\backslash gtrsim 21\$ of the 27 survey positions (\$\backslash geq 78\backslash\%\$ ), confirming the ubiquity of molecular gas in the ISM as traced by this spectral line. With few exceptions, the main OH lines at 1665 and 1667 MHz appear in the ratio of 5:9 characteristic of LTE at our sensitivity levels. No OH absorption features are recorded in the area of the present survey, in agreement with the low levels of continuum background emission in this direction. At each pointing the OH emission appears in several components extending over a range of radial velocity and coinciding with well-known features of Galactic structure such as the Local Arm and the Perseus Arm. In contrast, little CO emission is seen in the survey area; less than half of the \$\backslash gtrsim 50\$ identified OH components show detectable CO at the CfA sensitivity levels, and these are generally faint. There are no CO profiles without OH emission. With few exceptions, peaks in the OH profiles coincide with peaks in the GBT HI spectra (obtained concurrently, FWHM \$8.9'\$), although the converse is not true. We conclude that main-line OH emission is a promising tracer for the "dark molecular gas" in the Galaxy discovered earlier in Far-IR and gamma-ray emission. Further work is needed to establish the quantitative details of this connection.},

abstract = {A two dimensional hydrochemical hybrid code, KM2, is constructed to deal with astrophysical problems that would require coupled hydrodynamical and chemical evolution. The code assumes axisymmetry in cylindrical coordinate system, and consists of two modules: a hydrodynamics module and a chemistry module. The hydrodynamics module solves hydrodynamics using a Godunov-type finite volume scheme and treats included chemical species as passively advected scalars. The chemistry module implicitly solves non-equilibrium chemistry and change of the energy due to thermal processes with transfer of external ultraviolet radiation. Self-shielding effects on photodissociation of CO and H\$\_2\$ are included. In this introductory paper, the adopted numerical method is presented, along with code verifications using the hydrodynamics modules, and a benchmark on the chemistry module with reactions specific to a photon-dominated region (PDR). Finally, as an example of the expected capability, the hydrochemical evolution of a PDR is presented based on the PDR benchmark.},

abstract = {We consider the application of compressed sensing (CS) to the estimation of doubly selective channels within pulse-shaping multicarrier systems (which include OFDM systems as a special case). By exploiting sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain, CS-based channel estimation allows for an increase in spectral efficiency through a reduction of the number of pilot symbols. For combating leakage effects that limit the delay-Doppler sparsity, we propose a sparsity-enhancing basis expansion and a method for optimizing the basis with or without prior statistical information about the channel. We also present an alternative CS-based channel estimator for (potentially) strongly time-frequency dispersive channels, which is capable of estimating the "off-diagonal" channel coefficients characterizing intersymbol and intercarrier interference (ISI/ICI). For this estimator, we propose a basis construction combining Fourier (exponential) and prolate spheroidal sequences. Simulation results assess the performance gains achieved by the proposed sparsity-enhancing processing techniques and by explicit estimation of ISI/ICI channel coefficients.},

abstract = {Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results.   Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn.   In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].},

This scheme turns out to be near-optimal for the memoryless Gaussian source in the sense of achieving the zero-rate slope of its distortion-rate function. Motivated by this finding, we then propose a scheme comprised of iterating the above lossy compressor on an appropriately transformed version of the difference between the source and its reconstruction from the previous iteration. The proposed scheme achieves the rate distortion function of the Gaussian memoryless source (under squared error distortion) when employed on any finite-variance ergodic source. It further possesses desirable properties we respectively refer to as infinitesimal successive refinability, ratelessness, and complete separability. Its storage and computation requirements are of order no more than \$\backslash frac\{n\^{}2\}\{\backslash log\^{}\{\backslash beta\} n\}\$ per source symbol for \$\backslash beta>0\$ at both the encoder and decoder. Though the details of its derivation, construction, and analysis differ considerably, we discuss similarities between the proposed scheme and the recently introduced Sparse Regression Codes (SPARC) of Venkataramanan et al.},

abstract = {In such different domains as statistical physics and spin glasses, neurosciences, social science, economics and finance, large ensemble of interacting individuals taking their decisions either in accordance (mainstream) or against (hipsters) the majority are ubiquitous. Yet, trying hard to be different often ends up in hipsters consistently taking the same decisions, in other words all looking alike. We resolve this apparent paradox studying a canonical model of statistical physics, enriched by incorporating the delays necessary for information to be communicated. We show a generic phase transition in the system: when hipsters are too slow in detecting the trends, they will keep making the same choices and therefore remain correlated as time goes by, while their trend evolves in time as a periodic function. This is true as long as the majority of the population is made of hipsters. Otherwise, hipsters will be, again, largely aligned, towards a constant direction which is imposed by the mainstream choices. Beyond the choice of the best suit to wear this winter, this study may have important implications in understanding dynamics of inhibitory networks of the brain or investment strategies finance, or the understanding of emergent dynamics in social science, domains in which delays of communication and the geometry of the systems are prominent.},

For random matrices with independent standard Gaussian entries, it is known that, when is k-sparse, there is a precisely determined phase transition: for a certain region in the (k/n,n/N)-phase diagram, convex optimization typically finds the sparsest solution, whereas outside that region, it typically fails. It has been shown empirically that the same property--with the same phase transition location--holds for a wide range of non-Gaussian random matrix ensembles. We report extensive experiments showing that the Gaussian phase transition also describes numerous deterministic matrices, including Spikes and Sines, Spikes and Noiselets, Paley Frames, Delsarte-Goethals Frames, Chirp Sensing Matrices, and Grassmannian Frames. Namely, for each of these deterministic matrices in turn, for a typical k-sparse object, we observe that convex optimization is successful over a region of the phase diagram that coincides with the region known for Gaussian random matrices. Our experiments considered coefficients constrained to X(N) for four different sets X [symbol: see text]\{[0, 1], R(=), R, C\}, and the results establish our finding for each of the four associated phase transitions.},

Existence and uniqueness of a suitable measure-preserving map is established by formulating the problem in the context of optimal transport theory. We discuss various means of explicitly parameterizing the map and computing it efficiently through solution of an optimization problem, exploiting gradient information from the forward model when possible. The resulting algorithm overcomes many of the computational bottlenecks associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Advantages of a map-based representation of the posterior include analytical expressions for posterior moments and the ability to generate arbitrary numbers of independent posterior samples without additional likelihood evaluations or forward solves. The optimization approach also provides clear convergence criteria for posterior approximation and facilitates model selection through automatic evaluation of the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach on nonlinear inverse problems of varying dimension, involving the inference of parameters appearing in ordinary and partial differential equations.},

The ingredients in the model are a graph, where the vertices correspond to the firms and the edges describe the network of interdependencies between the firms, a parameter for each vertex that captures the individual propensity of that firm to default, and a parameter for each edge that captures the joint propensity of the two connected firms to default. The correlated default model can be re-rewritten as a standard Ising model on the graph by identifying the set of defaulting firms in the default model with the set of sites in the Ising model for which the spin is +1. We ask whether there is a suitable continuous time Markov chain taking values in the subsets of the vertex set such that the initial state of the chain is the empty set, each jump of the chain involves the inclusion of a single extra vertex, the distribution of the chain at some fixed time horizon time is the one given by the default model, and the distribution of the chain for other times is described by a probability distribution in the same family as the default model. We show for three simple but financially natural special cases that this is not possible outside of the trivial case where there is complete independence between the firms.},

abstract = {We present the concept of an acoustic rake receiver---a microphone beamformer that uses echoes to improve the noise and interference suppression. The rake idea is well-known in wireless communications; it involves constructively combining different multipath components that arrive at the receiver antennas. Unlike spread-spectrum signals used in wireless communications, speech signals are not orthogonal to their shifts. Therefore, we focus on the spatial structure, rather than temporal. Instead of explicitly estimating the channel, we create correspondences between early echoes in time and image sources in space. These multiple sources of the desired and the interfering signal offer additional spatial diversity that we can exploit in the beamformer design.   We present several "intuitive" and optimal formulations of acoustic rake receivers, and show theoretically and numerically that the rake formulation of the maximum signal-to-interference-and-noise beamformer offers significant performance boosts in terms of noise and interference suppression. Beyond signal-to-noise ratio, we observe gains in terms of the $\backslash$emph\{perceptual evaluation of speech quality\} (PESQ) metric for the speech quality.

abstract = {Sparse estimation methods are aimed at using or obtaining parsimonious representations of data or models. While naturally cast as a combinatorial optimization problem, variable or feature selection admits a convex relaxation through the regularization by the \$\backslash ell\_1\$-norm. In this paper, we consider situations where we are not only interested in sparsity, but where some structural prior knowledge is available as well. We show that the \$\backslash ell\_1\$-norm can then be extended to structured norms built on either disjoint or overlapping groups of variables, leading to a flexible framework that can deal with various structures. We present applications to unsupervised learning, for structured sparse principal component analysis and hierarchical dictionary learning, and to supervised learning in the context of non-linear variable selection.},

@article{Mota2013e,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the design of distributed algorithms for solving optimization problems. We consider networks where each node has exclusive access to a cost function, and design algorithms that make all nodes cooperate to find the minimum of the sum of all the cost functions. Several problems in signal processing, control, and machine learning can be posed as such optimization problems. Given that communication is often the most energy-consuming operation in networks, it is important to design communication-efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this thesis are a classification scheme for distributed optimization and a set of corresponding communication-efficient algorithms.   The class of optimization problems we consider is quite general, since each function may depend on arbitrary components of the optimization variable, and not necessarily on all of them. In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption in distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to reduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our classification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for example the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions depend on all the components of the variable.   In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the communications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with each node is processed locally. We show several applications including average consensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed scenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for distributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of communication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a particular application.},

@article{Cai2008,
abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem, and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries.   This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative and produces a sequence of matrices (X\^{}k, Y\^{}k) and at each step, mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix Y\^{}k. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates X\^{}k is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. We provide numerical examples in which 1,000 by 1,000 matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4\% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with linearized Bregman iterations for l1 minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.},

In particular, we offer an asymptotic characterization of the behavior of the (upper bound to the) misclassification probability associated with the optimal Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) classifier that depends on quantities that are dual to the concepts of diversity gain and coding gain in multi-antenna communications. The diversity, which is shown to determine the rate at which the probability of misclassification decays in the low noise regime, is shown to depend on the geometry of the source, the geometry of the measurement system and their interplay. The measurement gain, which represents the counterpart of the coding gain, is also shown to depend on geometrical quantities. It is argued that the diversity order and the measurement gain also offer an optimization criterion to perform dictionary learning for compressive classification applications.},

abstract = {Finding the sparse solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations has many applications, especially, it is used in Compressed Sensing (CS), Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), and sparse decomposition of signals on overcomplete dictionaries. We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed \$\backslash ell\^{}0\$ (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the \$\backslash ell\^{}1\$ norm, but it tries to directly minimize the \$\backslash ell\^{}0\$ norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the \$\backslash ell\^{}0\$ norm of a vector. However, in previous papers, we did not provide a complete convergence proof for SL0. In this paper, we study the convergence properties of SL0, and show that under a certain sparsity constraint in terms of Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP), and with a certain choice of parameters, the convergence of SL0 to the sparsest solution is guaranteed. Moreover, we study the complexity of SL0, and we show that whenever the dimension of the dictionary grows, the complexity of SL0 increases with the same order as Matching Pursuit (MP), which is one of the fastest existing sparse recovery methods, while contrary to MP, its convergence to the sparsest solution is guaranteed under certain conditions which are satisfied through the choice of parameters.},

abstract = {Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results.   Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn.   In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].},

@article{Fry2015b,
abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to consistently compare the assembly of dwarf galaxies in both \$\backslash Lambda\$ dominated, Cold (CDM) and Self--Interacting (SIDM) dark matter models. The SIDM model adopts a constant cross section of 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$, a relatively large value to maximize its effects. These are the first SIDM simulations that are combined with a description of stellar feedback that naturally drives potential fluctuations able to create dark matter cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower the central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 Km/s. This is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos have relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time scales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ \$<\$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback. At a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and SIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc. At larger halo masses (\$\backslash sim\$ 10\$\^{}\{10\}\$ solar masses), the introduction of baryonic processes creates field dwarf galaxies with dark matter cores and central DM\$+\$baryon distributions that are effectively indistinguishable between CDM and SIDM. Both models are in broad agreement with observed Local Group field galaxies across the range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate SIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross section that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 \$cm\^{}\{2\}/g\$ for halos with V\$\_\{max\}\$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced.},

A micron-sized cocontinuous morphology was stabilized by a monolayer of silica nanoparticles at the interface. Real-time observation of coalescence dynamics in co-continuous polymer blends stabilized by interfacial particles was for the first time achieved via laser scanning confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that suppression of coalescence arises from coverage of interfaces by nanoparticles. Furthermore, by combining confocal microscopy with rheology, we correlated the rheological response of a cocontinuous structure with its morphology change. We found that the rheological behavior can be attributed to competition between interface shrinkage and particle network formation. In addition, we showed that a particle scaffold is maintained even after the remixing of two polymer phases above the spinodal point. Finally, we also discussed differences between the shear response of the particle-stabilized cocontinuous structure and normal colloidal gels: the former one is more fragile than the latter under shear.},

Equivalently, is there a \$G\$-equivariant biholomorphism \$\backslash Phi\backslash colon X\backslash to V\$ where \$V\$ is a \$G\$-module? There is an intrinsic stratification of the categorical quotient \$Q\_X\$, called the Luna stratification, where the strata are labeled by isomorphism classes of representations of reductive subgroups of \$G\$.

abstract = {We study the compressed sensing reconstruction problem for a broad class of random, band-diagonal sensing matrices. This construction is inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory. As demonstrated heuristically and numerically by Krzakala et al. $\backslash$cite\{KrzakalaEtAl\}, message passing algorithms can effectively solve the reconstruction problem for spatially coupled measurements with undersampling rates close to the fraction of non-zero coordinates.   We use an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and analyze it through the state evolution method. We give a rigorous proof that this approach is successful as soon as the undersampling rate \$\backslash delta\$ exceeds the (upper) R$\backslash$'enyi information dimension of the signal, \$\backslash uRenyi(p\_X)\$. More precisely, for a sequence of signals of diverging dimension \$n\$ whose empirical distribution converges to \$p\_X\$, reconstruction is with high probability successful from \$\backslash uRenyi(p\_X)\backslash, n+o(n)\$ measurements taken according to a band diagonal matrix.   For sparse signals, i.e., sequences of dimension \$n\$ and \$k(n)\$ non-zero entries, this implies reconstruction from \$k(n)+o(n)\$ measurements. For `discrete' signals, i.e., signals whose coordinates take a fixed finite set of values, this implies reconstruction from \$o(n)\$ measurements. The result is robust with respect to noise, does not apply uniquely to random signals, but requires the knowledge of the empirical distribution of the signal \$p\_X\$.},

In a search problem, we are given an input x, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A\_x with high probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent. More precisely, for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R\_S such that, if C is any "reasonable" complexity class, then R\_S is in the search version of C if and only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that SampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can efficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and only if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers can solve. A second application is that, assuming a plausible conjecture, there exists a search problem R that can be solved using a simple linear-optics experiment, but that cannot be solved efficiently by a classical computer unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. That application will be described in a forthcoming paper with Alex Arkhipov on the computational complexity of linear optics.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio has been widely considered as one of the prominent solutions to tackle the spectrum scarcity. While the majority of existing research has focused on single-band cognitive radio, multiband cognitive radio represents great promises towards implementing efficient cognitive networks compared to single-based networks. Multiband cognitive radio networks (MB-CRNs) are expected to significantly enhance the network's throughput and provide better channel maintenance by reducing handoff frequency. Nevertheless, the wideband front-end and the multiband spectrum access impose a number of challenges yet to overcome. This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the recent advancements in multiband spectrum sensing techniques, their limitations, and possible future directions to improve them. We study cooperative communications for MB-CRNs to tackle a fundamental limit on diversity and sampling. We also investigate several limits and tradeoffs of various design parameters for MB-CRNs. In addition, we explore the key MB-CRNs performance metrics that differ from the conventional metrics used for single-band based networks.},

The SU intends to maximize the benefit of the feedback messages on the primary link to reduce SU interference for primary user (PU) and makes opportunistic use of the channel to transmit his packets. We assume that SU has erroneous access to feedback information of PU. We propose a three power level scheme and study the tradeoff between degradation in EC of SU and reliability of PU defined as the success rate of the transmitted packets. Our analysis shows that increase in error in feedback access causes more interference to PU and packet success rate decreases correspondingly.},

Fault removal does not delete the faulty signal data but, instead, massages the fault from the data. We assume that only one fault occurs at any one time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric Gaussian process models for both the physical phenomenon and the fault. In order to facilitate fault removal we introduce the Markov Region Link kernel for handling non-stationary Gaussian processes. This kernel is piece-wise stationary but guarantees that functions generated by it and their derivatives (when required) are everywhere continuous. We apply this kernel to the removal of drift and bias errors in faulty sensor data and also to the recovery of EOG artifact corrupted EEG signals.},

It is motivated by fundamental questions arising from the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs in theoretical computer science and from problems in the theory of social choice in economics.   We prove an invariance principle for multilinear polynomials with low influences and bounded degree; it shows that under mild conditions the distribution of such polynomials is essentially invariant for all product spaces. Ours is one of the very few known non-linear invariance principles. It has the advantage that its proof is simple and that the error bounds are explicit. We also show that the assumption of bounded degree can be eliminated if the polynomials are slightly ``smoothed''; this extension is essential for our applications to ``noise stability''-type problems.   In particular, as applications of the invariance principle we prove two conjectures: the ``Majority Is Stablest'' conjecture from theoretical computer science, which was the original motivation for this work, and the ``It Ain't Over Till It's Over'' conjecture from social choice theory.},

@article{Akin2014,
abstract = {In cognitive radio systems, employing sensing-based spectrum access strategies, secondary users are required to perform channel sensing in order to detect the activities of primary users. In realistic scenarios, channel sensing occurs with possible errors due to miss-detections and false alarms. As another challenge, time-varying fading conditions in the channel between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver have to be learned via channel estimation. In this paper, performance of causal channel estimation methods in correlated cognitive radio channels under imperfect channel sensing results is analyzed, and achievable rates under both channel and sensing uncertainty are investigated. Initially, cognitive radio channel model with channel sensing error and channel estimation is described. Then, using pilot symbols, minimum mean square error (MMSE) and linear-MMSE (L-MMSE) estimation methods are employed at the secondary receiver to learn the channel fading coefficients. Expressions for the channel estimates and mean-squared errors (MSE) are determined, and their dependencies on channel sensing results, and pilot symbol period and energy are investigated. Since sensing uncertainty leads to uncertainty in the variance of the additive disturbance, channel estimation strategies and performance are interestingly shown to depend on the sensing reliability. It is further shown that the L-MMSE estimation method, which is in general suboptimal, performs very close to MMSE estimation. Furthermore, assuming the channel estimation errors and the interference introduced by the primary users as zero-mean and Gaussian distributed, achievable rate expressions of linear modulation schemes and Gaussian signaling are determined. Subsequently, the training period, and data and pilot symbol energy allocations are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable rates for both signaling schemes.},

We also present a comparison inequality that bounds the expectation of a convex function of a martingale difference sequence shifted to the [0,1] interval by the expectation of the same function of independent Bernoulli variables. This inequality is applied to derive a tighter analog of Hoeffding-Azuma's inequality.},

@article{Barbarino2015,
abstract = {The joint action of a synthetic gauge potential and of atomic contact repulsion in a one-dimensional alkaline-earth(-like) fermionic gas with nuclear spin I leads to the existence of a hierarchy of fractional insulating and conducting states with intriguing properties. We unveil the existence and the features of those phases by means of both analytical bosonization techniques and numerical methods based on the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. In particular, we show that the gapless phases can support helical modes, whereas the gapped states, which appear under certain conditions, are characterised both by density and magnetic order. Several distinct features emerge solely for spin I larger than 1/2, thus making their study with cold-atoms unique. We will finally argue that these states are related to the properties of an unconventional fractional quantum Hall effect in the thin-torus limit. The properties of this hierarchy of states can be experimentally studied in state-of-the-art cold-atom laboratories.},

abstract = {Wideband spectrum sensing in heterogenous cognitive radio networks has two significant challenges to tackle. One is the spectrum acquisition in the wideband scenario due to the limited sampling capability; the other is how to collaborate among the secondary users. Compressed spectrum sensing provides a powerful approach to acquire wideband signal. Moreover, most cooperative spectrum sensing methods assume that all the secondary users experience the same occupancy of primary users, which may be infeasible in a heterogenous spectrum environment where secondary users at different locations may be affected by different primary users. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to represent and fuse multi-prior information from one hop neighboring secondary users. Belief propagation (BP) is used for the statistical inference of the spectrum occupancy. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BP based cooperative compressed spectrum sensing can effectively achieve cooperation in heterogenous environments and improve performance of compressed spectrum sensing under a low sampling rate and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compared with the other distributed cooperative compressed sensing methods.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

abstract = {The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

@article{Malioutov2010,
abstract = {Compressed sensing allows perfect recovery of sparse signals (or signals sparse in some basis) using only a small number of random measurements. Existing results in compressed sensing literature have focused on characterizing the achievable performance by bounding the number of samples required for a given level of signal sparsity. However, using these bounds to minimize the number of samples requires a-priori knowledge of the sparsity of the unknown signal, or the decay structure for near-sparse signals. Furthermore, there are some popular recovery methods for which no such bounds are known. In this paper, we investigate an alternative scenario where observations are available in sequence. For any recovery method, this means that there is now a sequence of candidate reconstructions. We propose a method to estimate the reconstruction error directly from the samples themselves, for every candidate in this sequence. This estimate is universal in the sense that it is based only on the measurement ensemble, and not on the recovery method or any assumed level of sparsity of the unknown signal. With these estimates, one can now stop observations as soon as there is reasonable certainty of either exact or sufficiently accurate reconstruction. They also provide a way to obtain "run-time" guarantees for recovery methods that otherwise lack a-priori performance bounds. We investigate both continuous (e.g. Gaussian) and discrete (e.g. Bernoulli) random measurement ensembles, both for exactly sparse and general near-sparse signals, and with both noisy and noiseless measurements.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio has emerged as one of the most promising candidate solutions to improve spectrum utilization in next generation cellular networks. A crucial requirement for future cognitive radio networks is wideband spectrum sensing: secondary users reliably detect spectral opportunities across a wide frequency range. In this article, various wideband spectrum sensing algorithms are presented, together with a discussion of the pros and cons of each algorithm and the challenging issues. Special attention is paid to the use of sub-Nyquist techniques, including compressive sensing and multichannel sub- Nyquist sampling techniques.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is viewed as a novel approach for improving the utilization of a precious natural resource: the radio electromagnetic spectrum. The cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio, is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli, with two primary objectives in mind: highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed; efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management. This work also discusses the emergent behavior of cognitive radio.},

abstract = {Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon's theorem: the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal (Nyquist rate). In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

@article{Baron2005,
abstract = {Compressed sensing is an emerging field based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressed sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. We study in detail three simple models for jointly sparse signals, propose algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections, and characterize theoretically and empirically the number of measurements per sensor required for accurate reconstruction. We establish a parallel with the Slepian-Wolf theorem from information theory and establish upper and lower bounds on the measurement rates required for encoding jointly sparse signals. In two of our three models, the results are asymptotically best-possible, meaning that both the upper and lower bounds match the performance of our practical algorithms. Moreover, simulations indicate that the asymptotics take effect with just a moderate number of signals. In some sense DCS is a framework for distributed compression of sources with memory, which has remained a challenging problem for some time. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor networks and arrays.},

abstract = {In emerging cognitive radio (CR) networks with spectrum sharing, the first cognitive task preceding any dynamic spectrum access is the sensing and identification of spectral holes in wireless environments. This paper develops a distributed compressed spectrum sensing approach for (ultra-)wideband CR networks. Compressed sensing is performed at local CRs to scan the very wide spectrum at practical signal-acquisition complexity. Meanwhile, spectral estimates from multiple local CR detectors are fused to collect spatial diversity gain, which improves the sensing quality especially under fading channels. New distributed consensus algorithms are developed for collaborative sensing and fusion. Using only one-hop local communications, these distributed algorithms converge fast to the globally optimal solutions even for multi-hop CR networks, at low communication and computation load scalable to the network size.},

abstract = {Wireless technology is a truly revolutionary paradigm shift, enabling multimedia communications between people and devices from any location. It also underpins exciting applications such as sensor networks, smart homes, telemedicine, and automated highways. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the underlying theory, design techniques and analytical tools of wireless communications, focusing primarily on the core principles of wireless system design. The book begins with an overview of wireless systems and standards. The characteristics of the wireless channel are then described, including their fundamental capacity limits. Various modulation, coding, and signal processing schemes are then discussed in detail, including state-of-the-art adaptive modulation, multicarrier, spread spectrum, and multiple antenna techniques. The concluding chapters deal with multiuser communications, cellular system design, and ad-hoc network design. Design insights and tradeoffs are emphasized throughout the book. It contains many worked examples, over 200 figures, almost 300 homework exercises, over 700 references, and is an ideal textbook for students. The book is also a valuable reference for engineers in the wireless industry. Andrea Goldsmith received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and is an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Prior to this she was an Assistant Professor at the California Institute of Technology. She has also held positions in industry at Maxim Technologies and AT\&T Bell Laboratories. She is a Fellow of the IEEE, has received numerous other awards and honors, and is the author of over 150 technical papers in the field of wireless communications.},

abstract = {Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon's theorem: the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal (Nyquist rate). In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

This not only provides new perspectives and insights but also allows us to employ the conceptual and algebraic tools of linear algebra in applications. We define several scalar measures of the degree of partial coherence of an optical field that are zero for full incoherence and unity for full coherence.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new rigorous theoretical framework to address discrete MRF-based optimization in computer vision. Such a framework exploits the powerful technique of Dual Decomposition. It is based on a projected subgradient scheme that attempts to solve an MRF optimization problem by first decomposing it into a set of appropriately chosen subproblems, and then combining their solutions in a principled way. In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful MRF optimization algorithms. For instance, in this manner we are able to derive algorithms that: 1) generalize and extend state-of-the-art message-passing methods, 2) optimize very tight LP-relaxations to MRF optimization, and 3) take full advantage of the special structure that may exist in particular MRFs, allowing the use of efficient inference techniques such as, e.g., graph-cut-based methods. Theoretical analysis on the bounds related with the different algorithms derived from our framework and experimental results/comparisons using synthetic and real data for a variety of tasks in computer vision demonstrate the extreme potentials of our approach.},

@article{Candes2005,
abstract = {Suppose we wish to recover an n-dimensional real-valued vector x\_0 (e.g. a digital signal or image) from incomplete and contaminated observations y = A x\_0 + e; A is a n by m matrix with far fewer rows than columns (n << m) and e is an error term. Is it possible to recover x\_0 accurately based on the data y?   To recover x\_0, we consider the solution x* to the l1-regularization problem min $\backslash$|x$\backslash$|\_1 subject to $\backslash$|Ax-y$\backslash$|\_2 <= epsilon, where epsilon is the size of the error term e. We show that if A obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns) and if the vector x\_0 is sufficiently sparse, then the solution is within the noise level $\backslash$|x* - x\_0$\backslash$|\_2 $\backslash$le C epsilon.   As a first example, suppose that A is a Gaussian random matrix, then stable recovery occurs for almost all such A's provided that the number of nonzeros of x\_0 is of about the same order as the number of observations. Second, suppose one observes few Fourier samples of x\_0, then stable recovery occurs for almost any set of p coefficients provided that the number of nonzeros is of the order of n/[$\backslash$log m]\^{}6. In the case where the error term vanishes, the recovery is of course exact, and this work actually provides novel insights on the exact recovery phenomenon discussed in earlier papers. The methodology also explains why one can also very nearly recover approximately sparse signals.},

@article{Shannon1948,
abstract = {THE recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {We propose a distributed algorithm, named Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (D-ADMM), for solving separable optimization problems in networks of interconnected nodes or agents. In a separable optimization problem there is a private cost function and a private constraint set at each node. The goal is to minimize the sum of all the cost functions, constraining the solution to be in the intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven to converge when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are strongly convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems from signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed sensing, and support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM requires less communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve a given accuracy level. Algorithms with low communication requirements are important, for example, in sensor networks, where sensors are typically battery-operated and communicating is the most energy consuming operation.},

abstract = {In cognitive radio networks, the first cognitive task preceding any form of dynamic spectrum management is the sensing and identification of spectrum holes in wireless environments. This paper develops a wavelet approach to efficient spectrum sensing of wideband channels. The signal spectrum over a wide frequency band is decomposed into elementary building blocks of subbands that are well characterized by local irregularities in frequency. As a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing singularities and edges, the wavelet transform is employed to detect and estimate the local spectral irregular structure, which carries important information on the frequency locations and power spectral densities of the subbands. Along this line, a couple of wideband spectrum sensing techniques are developed based on the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus and the multi-scale wavelet products. The proposed sensing techniques provide an effective radio sensing architecture to identify and locate spectrum holes in the signal spectrum},
