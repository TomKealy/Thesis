abstract = {A novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the distributive nature of CRSN, the proposed scheme deploys only one single narrowband sampler with ultra-low sampling rate at each nodes to accomplish the wideband spectrum sensing. First, the practical structure of the compressed sampler at each node is described in detail. Second, we show how the Fusion Center (FC) exploits the sampled signals with their spectrum randomly-aliased to detect the global wideband spectrum activity. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated through extensive simulations, which shows that it is particularly suitable for CRSN.},

abstract = {Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon's theorem: the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal (Nyquist rate). In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

In this paper, a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio is presented. Various aspects of spectrum sensing problem are studied from a cognitive radio perspective and multi-dimensional spectrum sensing concept is introduced. Challenges associated with spectrum sensing are given and enabling spectrum sensing methods are reviewed. The paper explains the cooperative sensing concept and its various forms. External sensing algorithms and other alternative sensing methods are discussed. Furthermore, statistical modeling of network traffic and utilization of these models for prediction of primary user behavior is studied. Finally, sensing features of some current wireless standards are given.},

abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

@article{Candes2006,
abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal fCN and a randomly chosen set of frequencies $\Omega$. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set $\Omega$? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of T spikes f(t)=$\sigma$$\tau$Tf($\tau$)$\delta$(t-$\tau$) obeying TCM(log N)-1 $\Omega$ for some constant CM>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N-M), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for CM which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of T spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(TlogN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to TlogN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},
