abstract = {A novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the distributive nature of CRSN, the proposed scheme deploys only one single narrowband sampler with ultra-low sampling rate at each nodes to accomplish the wideband spectrum sensing. First, the practical structure of the compressed sampler at each node is described in detail. Second, we show how the Fusion Center (FC) exploits the sampled signals with their spectrum randomly-aliased to detect the global wideband spectrum activity. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated through extensive simulations, which shows that it is particularly suitable for CRSN.},
